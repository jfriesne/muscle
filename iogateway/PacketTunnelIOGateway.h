/** This I/O gateway class is a "wrapper" class that you can use in conjunction with any other
  * AbstractMessageIOGateway class.  It will take the output of that class and packetize it in
  * such a way that the resulting data can be sent efficiently and correctly over an I/O channel that
  * would otherwise not accept datagrams larger than a certain size.  You can also use it by itself,
  * (without a slave I/O gateway), in which case it will use the standard Message::Flatten() encoding.
  *
  * In particular, this class will combine several small messages into a single packet, for efficiency,
  * and also fragment overly-large data into multiple sub-packets, if necessary, in order to keep
  * packet size smaller than the physical layer's MTU (Max Transfer Unit) size.  Note that this
  * class does not do any automated retransmission of lost data, so if you do use it over UDP
  * (or some other lossy I/O channel), you will need to handle lost Messages at a higher level.
  * If a message fragment is lost over the I/O channel, this class will simply drop the entire message
  * and continue.
