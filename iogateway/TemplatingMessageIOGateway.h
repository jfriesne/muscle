/** This is a MessageIOGateway that has additional logic so that it
  * can send and receive Messages via template-encoding, which can
  * significantly reduce bandwidth in use-cases where most of the Messages
  * being sent have the same fields/layout as each other.  It does this by
  * sending the Messages' fields-layout-metadata just once, as a separate
  * "Message Template"; after that it needs only to send the payload-data
  * of subsequent Messages with that same fields-layout, rather than resending
  * both the payload-data and meta-data for every Message.  This can reduce
  * bandwidth usage by 50-75%, although it does require the use of a
  * TemplatingMessageIOGateway on both ends of the connection in order for
  * the received payload-data to be correctly decoded back into a full Message
  * again for the receiving program to consume.

    *                          Defaults to (1024*1024), a.k.a. 1 megabyte of cached template data.
    *  @param outgoingEncoding The byte-stream format the message should be encoded into.
