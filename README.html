MUSCLE:  Crossbar Server, Portable Messaging and Support Classes<p>
5/28/82022 v8.60 jaf@meyersound.com<p>
Jeremy Friesner / Meyer Sound Laboratories Inc.<p>
Win32 compatibility contributions by Vitaliy Mikitchenko<p>
C# client code by Wilson Yeung<p>
SSL support code contributed by Nathan Whitehorn
</H2>
<p>
Note:  To compile the server, cd to the "server" subdirectory
and type 'make'.  The server executable, "muscled", should be
generated.  You can run this server from the command line, (type
"muscled help" to get info about some options) and connect to it
with any MUSCLE-aware program.
<p>
Alternatively, if you prefer a server that runs as a GUI program
and you have Qt installed, you can cd to the "platform/qt/qt_muscled"
subdirectory and type "qmake; make".  A GUI server program named
qt_muscled will be created.
<p>
The main goal of these classes is to provide an easy way to use
BMessage-style message passing across a network of heterogeneous
(MacOS/X, Linux, Windows, BSD, Unix, etc) systems.  The secondary goal
is just to provide some handy data containers and other utility classes. 
<p>
All of this code should compile under any up-to-date C++ compiler--
no proprietary APIs are used except inside of the appropriate #ifdefs.
<p>
For better documentation than this, please see the <a href="https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/">MUSCLE web site</a>.
<p>
This code has been compiled (typically with gmake, or MSVC in Windows) and tested in the following environments:
<p>
<ol>
<li>SUSE, Debian, and Ubuntu Linux on various 32-bit and 64-bit PCs</li>
<li>MacOS/X on various PowerPC, Intel, and ARM-based Macs</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows 7, Windows 10, and Windows 11 using Visual Studio 2008 or newer (via cmake)</li>
</ol>
<p>
It has no known bugs, but may have some yet-to-be-discovered ones.
Use at your own risk, Meyer Sound is not responsible for any disasters, blah blah blah.

<li>
<b>dataio/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains the DataIO interface class, which is an abstraction
   for any file-like device that can read or write sequences of bytes, and
   (optionally) seek to a specified position.  The DataIO class defines an
   interface for devices that you can Read() bytes from or Write() bytes to. 
   This folder also includes some useful implementations of the DataIO interface,
   including the following:
   <p>
   <table>
    <tr><td>AsyncDataIO</td><td>Wrapper that delegates I/O calls to an internal I/O thread</td></tr>
    <tr><td>ByteBufferDataIO</td><td>For file-style reading/writing to a ByteBuffer held in memory</td></tr>
    <tr><td>ByteBufferPacketDataIO</td><td>Like ByteBufferDataIO, but implements a PacketDataIO interface instead</td></tr>

<b>html/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains various HTML documentation for the MUSCLE project,
   including the Beginner's Guide to MUSCLE, a document on how to create
   custom MUSCLE servers, a directory of simple toy example programs,
   and the autodoc folder that contains files useful for creating API
   documentation using the DOxygen documentation tool.
<p>

<li>
<b>iogateway/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains the AbstractMessageIOGateway interface.
   An AbstractMessageIOGateway is a "gateway" object that knows
   how to manage bidirectional FIFO Message-stream traffic going to and
   coming from a DataIO object.  A gateway object queues outgoing MessageRefs,
   and when there is room in the outgoing buffer to send one, it flattens the
   next MessageRef in the outgoing-message-queue into a sequence of bytes,
   and sends those bytes out via the DataIO object.  It also reads bytes
   coming in from the DataIO object and assembles those bytes back into
   Message objects, which are then handed back to the AbstractGatewayMessageReceiver
   specified by the calling code.

   This directory also contains some useful implementations of the 
   AbstractMessageIOGateway interfaces, which are as follows:
   <p>
   <table>
    <tr><td>MessageIOGateway</td><td>Flattens Messages to the standard MUSCLE flattened-message binary format</td></tr>
    <tr><td>PlainTextMessageIOGateway</td><td>Converts free-form lines of ASCII text into Messages, and vice versa</td></tr>
    <tr><td>RawDataMessageIOGateway</td><td>Converts arbitrary raw data into Messages, and vice versa</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SLIPFramedDataMessageIOGateway</td><td>Similar to the RawDataMessageIOGateway class, except it uses SLIP framing conventions</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SSLSocketAdapterGateway</td><td>An adapter class to provide transparent support for OpenSSL's particular I/O needs</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SignalMessageIOGateway</td><td>Dummy gateway that doesn't send actual data, only indicates when data is available</td></tr>
    <tr><td>TemplatingMessageIOGateway</td><td>A specialized MessgeIOGateway class that sends Messages' metadata separately from their payload data, to reduce bandwidth</td></tr>
    <tr><td>PacketTunnelIOGateway</td><td>Flattens Messages into a series of fixed-size packets suitable for UDP transmission</td></tr>
    <tr><td>MiniPacketTunnelIOGateway</td><td>A lightweight version of PacketTunnelIOGateway that supports small Messages only</td></tr>
    <tr><td>ProxyIOGateway</td><td>A semi-abstract class with routines to implement calling out to a "child" I/O gateway</td></tr>
   </table>

<li>
<b>lang/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains the MUSCLE client APIs written for the various
   programming languages other than C++.  Languages currently supported are:
   C, C#, Delphi, Java, Java/J2ME, Python2, and Python3.
<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>message/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains MUSCLE's Message class.  A Message is a general-purpose
   data structure that is similar to BeOS's BMessage class.  A Message consists
   of a 32-bit integer "what code", plus zero or more named data fields, each of
   which can contain one or more data items of a specified type.
<p>
   Here are some relevant details:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
    MUSCLE messages support the following field types:

<p>
<table>
 <tr><td>int8</td><td>B_INT8_TYPE</td><td>8-bit signed integer values</td></tr>
 <tr><td>int16</td><td>B_INT16_TYPE</td><td>16-bit signed integer values</td></tr>
 <tr><td>int32</td><td>B_INT32_TYPE</td><td>32-bit signed integer values</td></tr>
 <tr><td>int64</td><td>B_INT64_TYPE</td><td>64-bit signed integer values</td></tr>
 <tr><td>bool</td><td>B_BOOL_TYPE</td><td>boolean values</td></tr>
 <tr><td>float</td><td>B_FLOAT_TYPE</td><td>IEEE 754 floating point values</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Pointer</td><td>B_POINTER_TYPE</td><td>Pointer values (non-flattenable)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Message</td><td>B_MESSAGE_TYPE</td><td>Message objects</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Flattenable</td><td>(various types)</td><td>Flattened Flattenable objects</td></tr>
 <tr><td>String</td><td>B_STRING_TYPE</td><td>UTF8 character strings</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Rect</td><td>B_RECT_TYPE</td><td>Rectangles (floats for left,top,right,bottom)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Point</td><td>B_POINT_TYPE</td><td>Points (floats for x,y)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Raw Data Buffer</td><td>B_RAW_TYPE</td><td>Sequences of zero or more untyped bytes<td></tr>
 <tr><td>Tag</td><td>B_TAG_TYPE</td><td>User-provided arbitrary objects (non-flattenable)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<li>
    Message is a subclass of Flattenable (see below), and therefore a Message can be serialized
    into a "flattened" buffer-of-bytes, which can be sent across a network or saved to a file,
    and later the bytes can be unflattened back into an equivalent Message object.  This is the
    basis for most MUSCLE network communication.  The flattening and unflattening is endian-aware,
    so that e.g. a PowerPC machine can communicate with an Intel machine without problems.
</li>
<li>
    Message has a GetFieldNameIterator() method, which returns
    a MessageFieldNameIterator object, which can be used to
    iterate over the fields of a Message.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<p>
<li>
<b>platform/qt/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains several classes that support clients that use TrollTech's
   Qt cross-platform GUI API.  The main one is the QMessageTransceiverThread class,
   which is a Qt-aware subclass of the MessageTransceiverThread class. 

   Using a QMessageTransceiverThread for your network I/O makes network communication
   very simple; instead of dealing with bytes and network protocols, you simply
   receive a Qt signal whenever incoming Messages are available, and call a method to
   send a Message, etc.

   This folder also contains some sub-directories that contain small example
   programs written for MUSCLE+Qt:
   <p>
   <table>
    <tr><td>qt_example</td><td>A simple multi-user 'game' and chat program</td></tr>
    <tr><td>qt_advanced_example</td><td>A demonstration of embedding a MUSCLE server thread inside a Qt application</td></tr>
    <tr><td>qt_muscled</td><td>A demonstration of a Qt app that runs a MUSCLE server as a child process</td></tr>
    <tr><td>qt_muscled_browser</td><td>A hierarchical browser GUI for seeing what data is present in a muscle server's database</td></tr>
   </table>
<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>reflector/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains server code for an n-way
   "message crossbar server" program.  This program will listen
   on a specified port for TCP connections, and will allow the
   TCP connections to "talk to each other" by forwarding Messages from
   one client to another (or to multiple others).
   The ServerProcessLoop() method implements the server's event loop,
   while the AbstractReflectSession class is the interface for the server's side
   of a TCP connection.  There are currently two subclasses of
   AbstractReflectSession included:  the DumbReflectSession
   class just reflects all received Messages to all connected clients, while
   the StorageReflectSession class adds nice features like wildcard-based
   Message routing, server-side data storage, and "notify-me-on-change"
   subscription services.  (See the MUSCLE Beginner's Guide for more info on this) 
   More elaborate logic can be added by creating subclasses of these classes.
<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>regex/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains code to support the use of regular expressions.
   This includes some C++ pattern-matching utility classes, as well as a
   sub-folder containing Henry Spencer's freeware C regex engine, for use
   in OS's that do not provide their own regex library.
<p>
   Classes implemented in this directory include:
   <p>
   <table>
   <tr><td>FilePathExpander</td><td>Expands shell-style wildcards into a list of file paths</td></tr>
   <tr><td>PathMatcher</td><td>Controls wildcard-directed recursive iterations down the tree of DataNode objects</td></tr>
   <tr><td>QueryFilter</td><td>Implements various predicate-logic operations on DataNode Message data</td></tr>
   <tr><td>StringMatcher</td><td>Does shell-style pattern matching on arbitrary character strings</td></tr>
   <tr><td>SegmentedStringMatcher</td><td>Like StringMatcher, except that the strings are divided up into substrings which are evaluated separately (e.g. "a*/b*")</td></tr>
   </table>
<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>server/</b>
<p>
   This contains the Makefile and main entry point for the "muscled"
   server executable, and the "admin" muscled-server-administration utility.
<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>support/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains various "small things" needed to compile the
   rest of the code.  These include byte-ordering macros, BeOS-style type
   codes, typedefs, and result constants, and the Flattenable
   interface definition.
<p>
   Classes implemented in this directory include:
   <p>
   <table>
   <tr><td>BitChord</td><td>Implements an ordered set of N individually-settable binary bits</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Flattenable</td><td>Interface for an object that can be "Flattened" into a serialized-binary representation, and Unflattened back again</td></tr>
   <tr><td>PseudoFlattenable</td><td>Same as Flattenable, but without the virtual methods.  Used as a tag for objects that can be flattened without runtime polymorphism</td></tr>
   <tr><td>NotCopyable</td><td>Inheriting from this class tells the compiler not to allow copies to made of objects of your subclass</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Point</td><td>A two-float x/y Point class</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Rect</td><td>A four-float left/top/width/height Rectangle class</td></tr>
   <tr><td>TamperEvidentValue</td><td>Templatized holder for an arbitrary object that will set a flag whenever the object is modified<td></td></tr>
   <tr><td>Tuple</td><td>Templatized class that holds a fixed-size array of N same-typed values</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Void</td><td>Placeholder class that contains no data</td></tr>
   </table>
<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>syslog/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains functions for logging event messages to stdout
   and/or to a file.  Log messages can be "raw" (works just like printf)
   or nicely formatted with the current time, redirected to a file, and so
   on.  The logging system also has optional functionality to rotate, compress
   and/or delete old log files, to avoid filling up too much disk space.
<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>system/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains classes that represent "generic" interfaces
   to OS-specific APIs; as such, they are not guaranteed to work on
   every platform.   Currently this directory contains the following classes:

   <p>
   <table>
    <tr><td>AcceptSocketsThread</td><td>A thread that accepts incoming TCP connections and hands them back to the parent thread</td</tr>
    <tr><td>AtomicCounter</td><td>Atomic-increment and atomic-decrement counter, for lock-free reference-counting</td</tr>
    <tr><td>DetectNetworkConfigChangesSession</td><td>A session object that notifies the program when the host computer's network configuration has changed</td</tr>

    <tr><td>SetupSystem</td><td>Provides standardized startup and shutdown routines that must be used by any MUSCLE process</td</tr>
    <tr><td>SharedMemory</td><td>Implements inter-process shared memory regions, including inter-process read/write locking ability</td</tr>
    <tr><td>SignalMultiplexer</td><td>Makes system signalling (e.g. catching of SIGINT or SIHUP) available to multiple pieces of code in the same process</td</tr>
    <tr><td>SystemInfo</td><td>Provides information about the environment the program is operating in (current directory, OS version, etc)</td</tr>
    <tr><td>Thread</td><td>An OS-neutral Thread class for multithreading purposes.  Includes send/receive Message functionality for easy control</td</tr>
    <tr><td>ThreadLocalStorage</td><td>An OS-neutral implementation of thread-local data storage</td</tr>
    <tr><td>ThreadPool</td><td>A thread pool implementation to allow handling of many Messages in parallel across a finite number of threads.</td</tr>

<li>
<b>test/</b>
<p>  
   This directory contains various test programs that I use
   to test and develop the code, and a Makefile to build them with.
   <p>
   Currently this directory contains the following programs:
   <p>
    <table>

<li>
<b>util/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains many useful one-off classes and function
   collections, including:
   <ol>
   <li>
   <b>BatchOperator</b>
   <p>
      BatchOperator is a templated mechanism for ensuring that a specified
      method gets called on the first-level recursion into a call tree, and
      that a matching method gets called on the final recursion out of the call tree.
      This is handy for making sure that setup and shutdown code is called exactly
      once at the beginning and once at the end of a set of nested recursive function calls.
   </p>
   <b>ByteBuffer</b>
   <p>
      ByteBuffer is an intelligent byte-array class, that stores
      its length, knows how to resize itself efficiently, is
      reference-countable and flattenable, etc.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>CountedObject</b>
   <p>
      CountedObject is a class that other classes can be derived from
      if you want to keep track of how many instances of them are in
      memory at any given time.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>CPULoadMeter</b>
   <p>
      CPULoadMeter reports the percentage of CPU time being used on
      the local computer from moment to moment (similar to what is
      reported in Task Manager under Windows, or Activity Monitor
      under MacOS/X)
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>Directory</b>
   <p>
      Directory is a platform-neutral API for scanning a filesystem
      directory and iterating over its contents.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>DebugTimer</b>
   <p>
      DebugTimer is a useful utility class that is useful for debugging
      performance problems.  It records the current time in its
      constructor, and then in its destructor it prints out the
      time that has elapsed since then (if the elapsed time is more
      than a specified minimum time).
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>FilePathInfo</b>
   <p>
      FilePathInfo is a platform-neutral API for querying the various
      properties of an entry at a specified location in a file system
      (e.g. is a file, a directory, or a symlink, how large is it,
      when was it created or modified, etc)
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>Hashtable</b>
   <p>
      Hashtable is a handy hash table class, with templated
      key and value types and the traditional O(1) lookup time.
      In addition to that, it includes other nice features, such
      as "safe" iterators (so you can modify the Hashtable while
      iterating through it), minimal-frequency memory allocations,
      and the ability to sort the table by key or by value (it
      maintains the ordering of the objects placed into the table). 
      Hashtable is used by the Message class, but is also quite
      useful on its own.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>ImmutableHashtablePool</b>
   <p>
      The ImmutableHashtablePool class is a utility class used
      to reduce memory usage when there are a large number of
      objects that each need to hold a Hashtable, but many of
      the held Hashtables will be identical to each other.
      ImmutableHashtablePool manages the allocation and caching
      of shared Hashtables such that when multiple objects need
      to reference an identical Hashtable, only one copy of that
      Hashtable needs to be present in RAM.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>IPAddress</b>
   <p>
      IPAddress is a class that represents an IPv4 or IPv6
      address in a standardized manner.  There is also an
      IPAddressAndPort class which represents the combination
      of an IP address and a port number.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>NestCount</b>
   <p>
      NestCount is a simple class for recording when the execution
      path enters or exits a particular function, and (optionally)
      making decisions based on whether a specified function is currently
      on the stack or not.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>MiscUtilityFunctions</b>
   <p>
      MiscUtilityFunctions.cpp is a catch-all for various useful functions
      that didn't fit anywhere else.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>NetworkUtilityFunctions</b>
   <p>
      NetworkUtilityFunctions.cpp is a repository of user-friendly
      wrapper functions around common BSD socket operations, such as setting
      up sockets to connect or accept TCP connections, or binding a UDP socket
      to a port.

   <b>ObjectPool</b>
   <p>
      The ObjectPool class is used to avoid excessive deletions and allocations
      of commonly used objects (such as Messages or RefCountMems). 
      It works by recycling the items for re-use, and is templated so it can be
      used for any type of object.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>PulseNode</b>
   <p>
      The PulseNode is an interface for objects that want to execute a particular
      action at a specified time.  It works in conjunction with the standard MUSCLE
      event loop.  Implementing classes define a Pulse() method that will be executed
      at a specified time, and a GetPulseTime() method that returns a clock value
      indicating when Pulse() should next be executed.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>Queue</b>
   <p> 
      The Queue class is just a little templatized double-ended
      queue (i.e. AddHead(), AddTail(), RemoveHead(), and RemoveTail()
      are O(1) operations).  It can be used as a Vector, Stack, or FIFO. 
      It's templatized for easy, type-safe reuse.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>RefCount</b>
   <p>
      The RefCount class implements generic reference counting for C++
      objects or arrays.  To enable reference counting on an object, you
      simply create a single Ref for that object, and (optionally)
      make one or more copies of the Ref via the copy constructor
      or the equals operator.   Then, when the last Ref object
      disappears, the C++ object or array is automatically deleted. It's
      not a garbage collector, but it beats having to keep track of all your
      allocations by hand...
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>Socket</b>
   <p>
      A reference-countable C++ class wrapper for a socket or file descriptor.
      Wrapping sockets and file descriptors in these objects allows them to
      be easily shared across objects without introducing the possibility of
      leaking them, or closing them before some other piece of code is done
      using them.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>SocketMultiplexer</b>
   <p>
      An easy-to-use wrapper around the select() socket-multiplexing API.
      It's also possible to use this as a wrapper around various select()
      alternatives, such as poll(), epoll(), or kqueue(), by recompiling
      the code with the appropriate compiler flags (e.g. -DMUSCLE_USE_POLL)
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>String</b>
   <p>
      The String class is just your basic character-string class,
      in this case inspired by the java.lang.String class from Java. 
      This class was originally written by Michael Olivero (mike95@mike95.com)
      and modified by myself.  String extends Flattenable,
      so it can be serialized in a generic manner.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>StringTokenizer</b>
   <p>
      A string tokenizing class similar to Java's Java.util.StringTokenizer,
      only more efficient.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>TimeUtilityFunctions</b>
   <p>
      TimeUtilityFunctions.h is a repository of functions for dealing with
      microsecond-accurate timing issues.
   <p>
   </li>
   </ol>
</li>
<li>
<b>zlib/</b>
<p>  
   This directory contains a subfolder named zlib (which contains the complete
   source code of the zlib compressor/decompressor package).  This directory
   also contains some zlib-related muscle source, including ZLibCodec, which is a
   convenience class for compressing and decompressing chunks of data, ZLibDataIO,
   a wrapper class for transparent compression and decompression of I/O streams,
   and ZLibUtilityFunctions, which contain some convenience functions for quickly
   compressing and decompressing a Message in a compatible manner.
