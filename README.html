MUSCLE:  Crossbar Server, Portable Messaging and Support Classes<p>
8/27/2015 v6.31 jaf@meyersound.com<p>
Jeremy Friesner / Meyer Sound Laboratories Inc.<p>
Win32 compatibility contributions by Vitaliy Mikitchenko<p>
C# client code by Wilson Yeung<p>
SSL support code contributed by Nathan Whitehorn
</H2>
<p>
Note:  To compile the server, cd to the "server" subdirectory
and type 'make'.  The server executable, "muscled", should be
generated.  You can run this server from the command line, (type
"muscled help" to get info about some options) and connect to it 
with any MUSCLE-aware program. 
<p>
Alternatively, if you prefer a server that runs as a GUI program
and you have Qt installed, you can cd to the "qtsupport/qt_muscled"
subdirectory and type "qmake; make".  A GUI server program named
qt_muscled will be created.
<p>
The main goal of these classes is to provide an easy way to use 
BMessage-style message passing across a network of heterogeneous 
(MacOS/X, Linux, Windows, BSD, Unix, etc) systems.  The secondary goal 
is just to provide some handy data containers and other utility classes.  
<p>
All of this code (except the atheossupport, besupport, and qtsupport 
directories) should compile under any up-to-date C++ compiler--
no proprietary APIs are used except inside of the appropriate #ifdefs.
<p>
For better documentation than this, please see the <a href="http://www.lcscanada.com/muscle">MUSCLE web site</a>.
<p>
This code has been compiled (typically with gmake, or MSVC8 in Windows) and tested in the following environments:
<p>
<ol>
<li>SUSE, Debian, and Ubuntu Linux on various 32-bit and 64-bit PCs</li>
<li>MacOS/X on various PowerPC and Intel based Macs</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows XP and Windows 7 using Visual Studio 2008 or higher (use the projects files in the 'vc++' subfolder)</li>
</ol>
<p>
It has no known bugs, but may have some yet-to-be-discovered ones.
Use at your own risk, Meyer Sound is not responsible for any disasters, blah blah blah.

Directory contents descriptions follow:
<p>
<ol>
<b>csharp/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains Wilson Yeung's alpha port of the Muscle client
   API to the C# language.  Email Wilson (wilson@whack.org) with questions
   about this port.

<li>
<b>dataio/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains the DataIO interface class, which is an abstraction
   for any file-like device that can read or write sequences of bytes, and 
   (optionally) seek to a specified position.  The DataIO class defines an 
   interface for devices that you can Read() bytes from or Write() bytes to.  
   This folder also includes some useful implementations of the DataIO interface, 
   including the following:
   <p> 
   <table>
    <tr><td>AsyncDataIO</td><td>Wrapper that delegates I/O calls to an internal I/O thread</td></tr>
    <tr><td>ByteBufferDataIO</td><td>For file-style reading/writing to a ByteBuffer held in memory</td></tr>
    <tr><td>ChildProcessDataIO</td><td>For launching a child process and communicating with it via its stdout/stdin</td></tr>
    <tr><td>FailoverDataIO.</td><td>Wrapper for automatic fallback to a second output when a primary output fails</td></tr>
    <tr><td>FileDataIO</td><td>For reading/writing via a C (FILE *) file handle</td></tr>
    <tr><td>FileDescriptorDataIO</td><td>For reading/writing via a Unix file descriptor</td></tr>
    <tr><td>MultiDataIO</td><td>Multiplexer wrapper class for writing to multiple outputs at once</td></tr>

<b>delphi/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains the MUSCLE client API written for the Delphi
   programming environment.  The contents of this directory were contributed
   by Matthew Emson; see the Readme.txt file in this directory for more information.
<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>html/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains various HTML documentation for the MUSCLE project,
   including the Beginner's Guide to MUSCLE, a document on how to create 
   custom MUSCLE servers, and the autodoc folder that contains files useful
   for creating API documentation using the DOxygen documentation tool.
<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>iogateway/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains the AbstractMessageIOGateway interface.
   An AbstractMessageIOGatweay is a "gateway" object that knows 
   how to manage bidirectional FIFO Message-stream traffic going to and 
   coming from a DataIO object.  A gateway object queues outgoing MessageRefs, 
   and when there is room in the outgoing buffer to send one, it flattens the
   next MessageRef in the outgoing-message-queue into a sequence of bytes,
   and sends those bytes out via the DataIO object.  It also reads bytes 
   coming in from the DataIO object and assembles those bytes back into
   Message objects, which are then handed back to the AbstractGatewayMessageReceiver
   specified by the calling code.

   This directory also contains some useful implementations of the  
   AbstractMessageIOGateway interfaces, which are as follows:
   <p> 
   <table>
    <tr><td>MessageIOGateway</td><td>Flattens Messages to the standard MUSCLE flattened-message binary format</td></tr>
    <tr><td>PacketTunnelIOGateway</td><td>Flattens Messages into a series of fixed-size packets suitable for UDP transmission</td></tr>
    <tr><td>PlainTextMessageIOGateway</td><td>Converts free-form lines of ASCII text into Messages, and vice versa</td></tr>
    <tr><td>RawDataMessageIOGateway</td><td>Converts arbitrary raw data into Messages, and vice versa</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SLIPFramedDataMessageIOGateway</td><td>Similar to the RawDataMessageIOGateway class, except it uses SLIP framing conventions</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SignalMessageIOGateway</td><td>Dummy gateway that doesn't send actual data, only indicates when data is available</td></tr>
   </table>

<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>java/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains a Java implementation of the MUSCLE client side
   API.  You can use the code in this folder to enable your Java program
   to talk to a MUSCLE server or any other program that speaks the MUSCLE
   Message protocol.
<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>message/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains MUSCLE's Message class.  A Message is a general-purpose
   data structure that is similar to BeOS's BMessage class.  A Message consists
   of a 32-bit integer "what code", plus zero or more named data fields, each of
   which can contain one or more data items of a specified type.
<p>
   Here are some relevant details:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
    MUSCLE messages support the following field types:

<p>
<table>
 <tr><td>int8</td><td>B_INT8_TYPE</td><td>8-bit signed integer values</td></tr>
 <tr><td>int16</td><td>B_INT16_TYPE</td><td>16-bit signed integer values</td></tr>
 <tr><td>int32</td><td>B_INT32_TYPE</td><td>32-bit signed integer values</td></tr>
 <tr><td>int64</td><td>B_INT64_TYPE</td><td>64-bit signed integer values</td></tr>
 <tr><td>bool</td><td>B_BOOL_TYPE</td><td>boolean values</td></tr>
 <tr><td>float</td><td>B_FLOAT_TYPE</td><td>IEEE 754 floating point values</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Pointer</td><td>B_POINTER_TYPE</td><td>Pointer values (non-flattenable)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Message</td><td>B_MESSAGE_TYPE</td><td>Message objects</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Flattenable</td><td>(various types)</td><td>Flattened Flattenable objects</td></tr>
 <tr><td>String</td><td>B_STRING_TYPE</td><td>UTF8 character strings</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Rect</td><td>B_RECT_TYPE</td><td>Rectangles (floats for left,top,right,bottom)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Point</td><td>B_POINT_TYPE</td><td>Points (floats for x,y)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Raw Data Buffer</td><td>B_RAW_TYPE</td><td>Sequences of zero or more untyped bytes<td></tr>
 <tr><td>Tag</td><td>B_TAG_TYPE</td><td>User-provided arbitrary objects (non-flattenable)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<li>
    Message is a subclass of Flattenable (see below), and therefore a Message can be serialized 
    into a "flattened" buffer-of-bytes, which can be sent across a network or saved to a file,
    and later the bytes can be unflattened back into an equivalent Message object.  This is the
    basis for most MUSCLE network communication.  The flattening and unflattening is endian-aware,
    so that e.g. a PowerPC machine can communicate with an Intel machine without problems.
</li>
<li>
    Message has a GetFieldNameIterator() method, which returns
    a MessageFieldNameIterator object, which can be used to
    iterate over the fields of a Message.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<p>
<li>
<b>minimessage/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains the MiniMessage and MiniMessageGateway C APIs.
   These APIs are C implementations of the C++ Message and MessageIOGateway classes.
   They can be used in cases where (for whatever reason) you want to code your
   program in C only and avoid C++.  They aren't as easy-to-use as the C++ implementation,
   but they should be sufficient for simple things, and they compile down to only
   a few dozen kilobytes of object code.  See the testmini.c and minireflectclient.c 
   test files in the tests directory for examples on how they are used.
<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>micromessage/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains the MicroMessage and MicroMessageGateway C APIs.
   These APIs are C implementations of the C++ Message and MessageIOGateway classes.
   These APIs go even farther towards minimalism than the minimessage APIs:  in
   particular, these APIs never allocate or free any data.  Instead of converting
   the message's flattened-data-bytes into a separate in-memory data structure like 
   Message and MiniMessage do, MicroMessage operates on the flattened-data-bytes directly.
   This makes for a potentially much more efficient implementation; the main downside
   is that when creating a MicroMessage, you can only append data; you cannot insert
   or remove fields that you previously added.
<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>python/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains a minimal MUSCLE client-side API written in Python.
   You can use the code in this directory to enable your Python scripts to talk
   to a MUSCLE server or any other program that speaks the MUSCLE Message protocol.
   Also included in this directory is some C++ glue code (in PythonUtilityFunctions.cpp)
   that is useful when embedding Python code into C++ code -- the glue code uses MUSCLE 
   Messages as to transfer arguments from C++ to Python context and back again.
<p>
</li>
<p>
<li>
<b>qtsupport/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains several classes that support clients that use TrollTech's
   Qt cross-platform GUI API.  The main one is the QMessageTransceiverThread class,
   which is a Qt-aware subclass of the MessageTransceiverThread class.  

   Using a QMessageTransceiverThread for your network I/O makes network communication
   very simple; instead of dealing with bytes and network protocols, you simply
   receive a Qt signal whenever incoming Messages are available, and call a method to
   send a Message, etc.

   This folder also contains some sub-directories that contain small example
   programs written for MUSCLE+Qt:
   <p>
   <table>
    <tr><td>qt_example</td><td>A simple multi-user 'game' and chat program</td></tr>
    <tr><td>qt_advanced_example</td><td>A demonstration of embedding a MUSCLE server thread inside a Qt application</td></tr>
    <tr><td>qt_muscled</td><td>A demonstration of a Qt app that runs a MUSCLE server as a child process</td></tr>
    <tr><td>qt_muscled_browser</td><td>A hierarchical browser GUI for seeing what data is present in a muscle server's database</td></tr>
   </table>
<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>reflector/</b>
<p> 
   This directory contains server code for an n-way
   "message crossbar server" program.  This program will listen
   on a specified port for TCP connections, and will allow the
   TCP connections to "talk to each other" by forwarding Messages from
   one client to another (or to multiple others).
   The ServerProcessLoop() method implements the server's event loop, 
   while the AbstractReflectSession class is the interface for the server's side
   of a TCP connection.  There are currently two subclasses of 
   AbstractReflectSession included:  the DumbReflectSession
   class just reflects all received Messages to all connected clients, while
   the StorageReflectSession class adds nice features like wildcard-based
   Message routing, server-side data storage, and "notify-me-on-change"
   subscription services.  (See the MUSCLE Beginner's Guide for more info on this)  
   More elaborate logic can be added by creating subclasses of these classes.
<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>regex/</b>
<p> 
   This directory contains code to support the use of regular expressions.
   This includes some C++ pattern-matching utility classes, as well as a 
   sub-folder containing Henry Spencer's freeware C regex engine, for use 
   in OS's that do not provide their own regex library.
<p>
   Classes implemented in this directory include:
   <p>
   <table>
   <tr><td>FilePathExpander</td><td>Expands shell-style wildcards into a list of file paths</td></tr>
   <tr><td>PathMatcher</td><td>Controls wildcard-directed recursive iterations down the tree of DataNode objects</td></tr>
   <tr><td>QueryFilter</td><td>Implements various predicate-logic operations on DataNode Message data</td></tr>
   <tr><td>StringMatcher</td><td>Does shell-style pattern matching on arbitrary character strings</td></tr>
   <tr><td>SegmentedStringMatcher</td><td>Like StringMatcher, except that the strings are divided up into substrings which are evaluated separately (e.g. "a*/b*")</td></tr>
   </table>
<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>sdlsupport/</b>
<p> 
   This directory contains the SDLMessageTransceiverThread class, which is
   a handy way to implement MUSCLE communication ability into your SDL program.
   SDLMessageTransceiverThread class is just a thin wrapper subclass around
   the MessageTransceiverThread class, but it interfaces MessageTransceiverThread
   to SDL's event-notification system.
<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>server/</b>
<p>
   This contains the Makefile and main entry point for the "muscled"
   server executable, and the "admin" muscled-server-administration utility.
<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>support/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains various "small things" needed to compile the
   rest of the code.  These include byte-ordering macros, BeOS-style type 
   codes, typedefs, and result constants, and the Flattenable 
   interface definition.
<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>syslog/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains functions for logging event messages to stdout
   and/or to a file.  Log messages can be "raw" (works just like printf)
   or nicely formatted with the current time, redirected to a file, and so
   on.  The logging system also has optional functionality to rotate, compress
   and/or delete old log files, to avoid filling up too much disk space.
<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>system/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains classes that represent "generic" interfaces
   to OS-specific APIs; as such, they are not guaranteed to work on
   every platform.   Currently this directory contains the following classes:

   <p>
   <table>
    <tr><td>AcceptSocketsThread</td><td>A thread that accepts incoming TCP connections and hands them back to the parent thread</td</tr>
    <tr><td>AtomicCounter</td><td>Atomic-increment and atomic-decrement counter, for lock-free reference-counting</td</tr>
    <tr><td>DetectNetworkConfigChangesSession</td><td>A session object that notifies the program when the host computer's network configuration has changed</td</tr>
    <tr><td>GlobalMemoryAllocator</td><td>Code to monitor and optionally restrict the program's heap usage</td</tr>
    <tr><td>MessageTransceiverThread</td><td>Runs a MUSCLE ReflectServer object in a separate thread.  Provides asynchronous I/O</td</tr>
    <tr><td>Mutex</td><td>Provides efficient in-process locking (aka critical sections) for thread-safety</td</tr>
    <tr><td>SetupSystem</td><td>Provides standardized startup and shutdown routines that must be used by any MUSCLE process</td</tr>
    <tr><td>SharedMemory</td><td>Implements inter-process shared memory regions, including inter-process read/write locking ability</td</tr>
    <tr><td>SignalMultiplexer</td><td>Makes system signalling (e.g. catching of SIGINT or SIHUP) available to multiple pieces of code in the same process</td</tr>
    <tr><td>SystemInfo</td><td>Provides information about the environment the program is operating in (current directory, OS version, etc)</td</tr>
    <tr><td>Thread</td><td>An OS-neutral Thread class for multithreading purposes.  Includes send/receive Message functionality for easy control</td</tr>
    <tr><td>ThreadLocalStorage</td><td>An OS-neutral implementation of thread-local data storage</td</tr>
    <tr><td>ThreadPool</td><td>A thread pool implementation to allow handling of many Messages in parallel across a finite number of threads.</td</tr>
   </table>
   <p>
</li>
<li>
<b>test/</b>
<p>   
   This directory contains various test programs that I use
   to test and develop the code, and a Makefile to build them with.
   <p>
   Currently this directory contains the following programs:
   <p>
    <table>
    <tr><td>bandwidthtester</td><td>Generates lots of Message traffic and measures how fast a MUSCLE server can receive it</td></tr>
    <tr><td>calctypecode</td><td>Prints out the decimal equivalent of a four-character ASCII what-code</td></tr>

<li>
<b>util/</b>
<p>
   This directory contains many useful one-off classes and function
   collections, including:
   <ol>
   <li>
   <b>BatchOperator</b>
   <p>
      BatchOperator is a templated mechanism for ensuring that a specified
      method gets called on the first-level recursion into a call tree, and
      that a matching method gets called on the final recursion out of the call tree.
      This is handy for making sure that setup and shutdown code is called a the 
      correct times.
   </p>
   <b>ByteBuffer</b>
   <p>
      ByteBuffer is an intelligent byte-array class, that stores
      its length, knows how to resize itself efficiently, is
      reference-countable and flattenable, etc.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>CountedObject</b>
   <p>
      CountedObject is a class that other classes can be derived from
      if you want to keep track of how many instances of them are in
      memory at any given time.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>CPULoadMeter</b>
   <p>
      CPULoadMeter reports the percentage of CPU time being used on
      the local computer from moment to moment (similar to what is
      reported in Task Manager under Windows, or Activity Monitor
      under MacOS/X)
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>Directory</b>
   <p>
      Directory is a platform-neutral API for scanning a filesystem
      directory and iterating over its contents.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>DebugTimer</b>
   <p>
      DebugTimer is a useful utility class that is useful for debugging
      performance problems.  It records the current time in its 
      constructor, and then in its destructor it prints out the
      time that has elapsed since then (if the elapsed time is more
      than a specified minimum time).
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>FilePathInfo</b>
   <p>
      FilePathInfo is a platform-neutral API for querying the various
      properties of an entry at a specified location in a file system
      (e.g. is a file, a directory, or a symlink, how large is it, 
      when was it created or modified, etc)
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>Hashtable</b>
   <p>
      Hashtable is a handy hash table class, with templated
      key and value types and the traditional O(1) lookup time.
      In addition to that, it includes other nice features, such
      as "safe" iterators (so you can modify the Hashtable while
      iterating through it), minimal-frequency memory allocations, 
      and the ability to sort the table by key or by value (it 
      maintains the ordering of the objects placed into the table).  
      Hashtable is used by the Message class, but is also quite 
      useful on its own.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>NestCount</b>
   <p>
      NestCount is a simple class for recording when the execution
      path enters or exits a particular function, and (optionally)
      making decisions based on whether a specified function is currently
      on the stack or not.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>NetworkUtilityFunctions</b>
   <p>
      NetworkUtilityFunctions.cpp is a repository for common BSD socket 
      operations (like setting up sockets to connect or accept connections) 
      that I'm tired of writing over and over again.  I think my API
      is much easier to use than the plain sockets API, although my 
      API handles TCP connections only.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>ObjectPool</b>
   <p>
      The ObjectPool class is used to avoid excessive deletions and allocations 
      of commonly used objects (such as Messages or RefCountMems).  
      It works by recycling the items for re-use, and is templated so it can be 
      used for any type of object.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>PulseNode</b>
   <p>
      The PulseNode is an interface for objects that want to execute a particular
      action at a specified time.  It works in conjunction with the standard MUSCLE
      event loop.  Implementing classes define a Pulse() method that will be executed
      at a specified time, and a GetPulseTime() method that returns a clock value
      indicating when Pulse() should next be executed.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>Queue</b>
   <p>  
      The Queue class is just a little templatized double-ended 
      queue (i.e. AddHead(), AddTail(), RemoveHead(), and RemoveTail() 
      are O(1) operations).  It can be used as a Vector, Stack, or FIFO.  
      It's templatized for easy, type-safe reuse.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>RefCount</b>
   <p>
      The RefCount class implements generic reference counting for C++ 
      objects or arrays.  To enable reference counting on an object, you 
      simply create a single Ref for that object, and (optionally) 
      make one or more copies of the Ref via the copy constructor 
      or the equals operator.   Then, when the last Ref object 
      disappears, the C++ object or array is automatically deleted. It's 
      not a garbage collector, but it beats having to keep track of all your 
      allocations by hand...
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>Socket</b>
   <p>
      A reference-countable C++ class wrapper for a socket or file descriptor.
      Wrapping sockets and file descriptors in these objects allows them to
      be easily shared across objects without introducing the possibility of
      leaking them, or closing them before some other piece of code is done
      using them.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>SocketMultiplexer</b>
   <p>
      An easy-to-use wrapper around the socket() (or poll()) socket-multiplexing API.  
      To use the poll()-based implementation, compile your code with -DMUSCLE_USE_POLL
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>String</b>
   <p>
      The String class is just your basic character-string class, 
      in this case inspired by the java.lang.String class from Java.  
      This class was originally written by Michael Olivero (mike95@mike95.com) 
      and modified by myself.  String extends Flattenable, 
      so it can be serialized in a generic manner.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>StringTokenizer</b>
   <p>
      A string tokenizing class similar to Java's Java.util.StringTokenizer,
      only more efficient.
   <p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>TimeUtilityFunctions</b>
   <p>
      TimeUtilityFunctions.h is a repository of functions for dealing with 
      microsecond-accurate timing issues.
   <p>

<b>vc++/</b>
<p>   
   This directory contains project files for building muscled under Visual C++
   for Windows.  These files were provided by Vitaliy Mikitchenko (aka VitViper)
<p>   
</li>
<li>
<b>winsupport/</b>
<p>   
   This directory contains the Win32MessageTransceiverThread class, which is
   useful for interface MUSCLE code to the standard Win32 GUI event loop.
   You can use this class to enable your Win32 C and C++ programs to communicate
   with a MUSCLE server or any other program that speaks the MUSCLE Message 
   protocol.
<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>zlib/</b>
<p>   
   This directory contains a subfolder named zlib (which contains the complete
   source code of the zlib compressor/decompressor package).  This directory
   also contains some zlib-related muscle source, including ZLibCodec, which is a
   convenience class for compressing and decompressing chunks of data, ZLibDataIO,
   a wrapper class for transparent compression and decompression of I/O streams,
   and ZLibUtilityFunctions, which contain some convenience functions for quickly
   compressing and decompressing a Message in a compatible manner.
