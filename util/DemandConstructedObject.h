/** This class wraps an object of the specified type, so that the wrapped object can be used as
 *  a member object but, without requiring its constructor to be called at the usual C++ construct-object time.
 *
 *  Instead, the wrapped object's constructor gets called at a time of the caller's choosing;
 *  typically when the wrapped object is first accessed.  This can be useful to avoid the
 *  overhead of constructing an object that may or may not ever be actually used for anything,
 *  while at the same time avoiding the overhead and uncertainty of a separate dynamic memory
 *  allocation for the object.
