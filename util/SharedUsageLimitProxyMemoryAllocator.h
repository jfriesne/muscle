     * @param groupKey A string that is used as a key by all processes in the group.
     *                 Any process that uses the same key will use the same shared memory limit.
     * @param memberID Our member ID in the group.  This number should be between zero and (groupSize-1) inclusive,
     *                 and should be different for each process in the process group.  It is used to keep track
     *                 of how much memory each process in the group is using.  If the memberID is less than zero,
     *                 this allocator will not track memory used by this process, and is then useful only to
     *                 watch memory used by other processes.
     * @param groupSize The maximum number of process that may be in the group.
     *                  This value should be the same for all process in a given group.
     * @param slaveRef Reference to a sub-MemoryAllocator whose methods we will call through to.
     * @param maxBytes The maximum number of bytes that may be allocated, in aggregate, by all the process
     *                 in the group.  This value should be the same for all process in a given group.
