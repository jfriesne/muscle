  * injection into a thread.  The use case is:  an ICallbackSubscriber in thread A
  * (e.g. a background networking thread) wants some functions to be called by thread B
  * (e.g. the GUI thread).
  *
  * To make that happen, the ICallbackSubscriber calls its RequestCallbackInDispatchThread()
  * method, which in turn calls the SignalDispatchThread() method of the ICallbackMechanism
  * it is registered to.  It is then the ICallbackMechanism's job to make sure that the
  * DispatchCallbacks() method gets called ASAP by thread B.
  *
  * ICallbackMechanism::DispatchCallbacks() will then call the DispatchCallbacks() method
  * on each registered ICallbackSubscriber.
