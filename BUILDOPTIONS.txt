muscled should compile fine with nothing more than a "cd muscle/server ; make" 
but if you feel like hacking around, here is a list of some 
compile-time constants that you can define in the CXXFLAGS variable
of your Makefile to alter muscle's behaviour:

-DMUSCLE_ENABLE_SSL
   Set this to enable built-in support for SSL connections via OpenSSL.
   (e.g. ReflectServer::SetSSLPrivateKey())

-DMUSCLE_USE_CPLUSPLUS11
   Set this to enable C++11-specific features such as move-constructors.

-DMUSCLE_AVOID_IPV6
   Set this to indicate that Muscle should be compiled without IPv6
   support.  The main difference with this flag is that muscle_ip_address
   will be defined a typedef'd alias for a uint32 (rather than a C++ class
   that holds 128 bits of data).

-DMUSCLE_SINGLE_THREAD_ONLY 
   Makes the Mutex class's methods compile down to no-ops.  Specify this if 
   you are able to guarantee that your program will never access MUSCLE
   code from more than one thread.

-DMUSCLE_USE_EPOLL
   Causes the SocketMultiplexer class to use the epoll() Linux system
   call instead of select().  This method is less portable, but 
   avoids the FD_SETSIZE limitation that select() introduces.
   Note that this flag is mutually exclusive with -DMUSCLE_USE_KQUEUE and
   -DMUSCLE_USE_POLL.

-DMUSCLE_USE_POLL
   Causes the SocketMultiplexer class to use the poll() system
   call instead of select().  This method is slightly less portable, but 
   avoids the FD_SETSIZE limitation that select() introduces.
   Note that this flag is mutually exclusive with -DMUSCLE_USE_KQUEUE
   and -DMUSCLE_USE_EPOLL.

-DMUSCLE_USE_KQUEUE
   Causes the SocketMultiplexer class to use the kqueue() and kevent() 
   system calls instead of select().  This method is less portable, but
   avoids the FD_SETSIZE limitation that select() introduces.
   Note that this flag is mutually exclusive with -DMUSCLE_USE_POLL and
   -DMUSCLE_USE_EPOLL.

-DMUSCLE_MAX_ASYNC_CONNECT_DELAY_MICROSECONDS=(#micros)
   If specified, MUSCLE's AddNewConnectSession() calls
   will force an asynchronous connection to fail after this
   many microseconds have elapsed.  If not defined, the
   default behavior is to let the operating system determine
   when the asynchronous connection should time out and fail.

-DMUSCLE_CATCH_SIGNALS_BY_DEFAULT
   If specified, ReflectServer will by default set up a signal 
   handler to catch signals (e.g. Control-C), and gracefully 
   exit its event loop when they are detected.  Without this
   flag, MUSCLE signal-handling routines will only be set up
   if you explicitly call SetSignalHandlingEnabled(true)
   somewhere in your code.
 
-DMUSCLE_USE_LIBRT
   If specified, GetRunTime64() and Snooze64() will use librt's
   high-resolution timing functions instead of the low-resolution
   ones supplied by older operating systems.  Note that if you 
   specify this flag, you should link with librt as well (-lrt).

-DMUSCLE_AVOID_MULTICAST_API
   Set this to omit the multicast API calls in NetworkUtilityFunctions.h.  
   This might be useful to do if compiling on a platform where multicast
   APIs aren't supported.

-DMUSCLE_ENABLE_KEEPALIVE_API
   Set this to make the TCP keepalive API calls in NetworkUtilityFunctions.h
   available for use.  (it's disabled by default to make sure that the
   keepalive functions won't break the build on platforms that don't 
   support keepalive).  Note that muscled itself won't use keepalive even 
   if this constant is specified; the functions are a convenience for 
   other MUSCLE-based applications to use if they wish.

-DMUSCLE_64_BIT_PLATFORM
   Set this to indicate that compilation is being done on a 64-bit platform.
   This flag will be set automatically in support/MuscleSupport.h if defines
   indicating a known 64-bit platform are detected; if not, you can set it
   yourself in the Makefile if necessary.

-DMUSCLE_USE_LLSEEK
   Force the FileDescriptorDataIO class to use the non-standard _llseek() command
   when compiled under Linux.  This should be done automatically in most cases
   where it is necessary, but you can force it also.

-DMUSCLE_PREFER_QT_OVER_WIN32
   Tell the Muscle Thread/Mutex/etc classes to prefer to use Qt Threading APIs over Win32 calls
   when both are available.  (By default, Win32 calls are preferred when running under Windows)

-DMUSCLE_ENABLE_MEMORY_PARANOIA=N 
   Put N overwrite-guards before and after each malloc() buffer, watch them for memory corruption

-DMUSCLE_NO_EXCEPTIONS 
   Tells muscle that exceptions won't be used.

-DMUSCLE_ENABLE_MEMORY_TRACKING 
   Enables system memory usage tracking (wrappers for new and delete that allow muscled to
   put an upper bound on the amount of memory it dynamically allocates, etc)

-DMUSCLE_AVOID_ASSERTIONS 
   makes MASSERT statements into no-ops

-DMUSCLE_AVOID_SIGNAL_HANDLING
   Disables the built-in support for catching signals and doing an orderly shutdown of
   the ReflectServer event loop in response.

-DMUSCLE_AVOID_INLINE_ASSEMBLY
   tells muscle to use boring old C/C++ code and avoid using any clever assembly-language code

-DMUSCLE_ENABLE_ZLIB_ENCODING 
   enables support for zlib compression of Messages

-DMUSCLE_TRACE_CHECKPOINTS=N 
   enable TCHECKPOINT tracing of last N checkpoints

-DMUSCLE_DISABLE_MESSAGE_FIELD_POOLS 
   turn off Object pooling for Message field objects; helpful for debugging

-DMUSCLE_MAX_OUTPUT_CHUNK=N 
   tell muscled not to send() more than N bytes of output per call

-DMUSCLE_INLINE_LOGGING 
   turn Log(), LogTime(), etc into simple printf() passthroughs

-DMUSCLE_DISABLE_LOGGING 
   turn Log(), LogTime(), etc into no-ops

-DMUSCLE_USE_MUTEXES_FOR_ATOMIC_OPERATIONS 
   Use Mutexes to simulate atomic inc/dec operations; useful if no other method is available

-DMUSCLE_MUTEX_POOL_SIZE=N
   If -DMUSCLE_USE_MUTEXES_FOR_ATOMIC_OPERATIONS is defined, then this can be defined to set the size of the Mutex pool to use.  Defaults to 256.

-DMUSCLE_POWERPC_TIMEBASE_HZ=N 
   Use mftb/mftbu for GetRunTime64() calls.  N is the frequency at which the register is incremented

-DMUSCLE_USE_PTHREADS 
   Use pthreads for thread operations

-DMUSCLE_DEFAULT_TCP_STALL_TIMEOUT=N 
   Number of microseconds to wait for a client to read TCP data before 
   giving up and closing his connection (defaults to 20 minutes' worth)

-DMUSCLE_FD_SETSIZE=N 
   Redefine the fd_setsize to another value (useful under Windows, where the default setsize is a measly 64)

-DMUSCLE_AVOID_NEWNOTHROW 
   Turns newnothrow into a synonym for "new", instead of "new (nothrow)"

-DMUSCLE_AVOID_FORKPTY 
   Tells the ChildProcessDataIO class not to compile in calls to forkpty(); instead it will use fork() only

-DMUSCLE_HASHTABLE_DEFAULT_CAPACITY=X 
   Number of value slots to initially pre-allocate in a Hashtable, by default (defaults to 7)
   Note that the pre-allocation is done the first time an object is Put() into the Hashtable.
   A new, empty Hashtable will have no pre-allocated slots.

-DSMALL_QUEUE_SIZE=N
   Number of value slots to initially pre-allocate in a Queue, by default.  (defaults to 3)

-DSMALL_MUSCLE_STRING_LENGTH=N 
   strings <= this length will be stored inline in the String object to avoid a malloc()... default is 7

-DMUSCLE_USE_QUERYPERFORMANCECOUNTER
   Tells MUSCLE's GetRunTime64() to use the higher-resolution 
   QueryPerformanceCounter() API instead of timeGetTime() when running under Windows.
   Specifying this flag increases GetRunTime64()'s accuracy, but QueryPerformanceCounter()
   is known not to work on some hardware.

-DMUSCLE_INCLUDE_SOURCE_LOCATION_IN_LOGTIME
   Compiles MUSCLE's and LogTime() function as a macro that includes the
   source code location in the call.  By enabling this it is possible to include
   the source of a message with the messge itself, should your code choose to do so.

-DMUSCLE_WARN_ABOUT_LOUSY_HASH_FUNCTIONS=200
   If defined, the Hashtable::EnsureSize() method will do some paranoia
   checking every time it resizes the Hashtable, to see if the Hashtable's
   average lookup-count (as calculated by CountAverageLookupComparisons())
   is greater than 2.00f (or whatever the preprocessor-define's value is,
   divided by 100).  If it is, a log message, debug info, and a stack trace
   will be printed.  Only enable this compiler flag when doing debugging/
   development/optimization (i.e. when you want to check to see if you 
   have any hash functions that aren't performing well), since it will
   significantly slow down your program when it is enabled.

-DMUSCLE_ENABLE_DEADLOCK_FINDER
   If specified, calls to Mutex::Lock() and Mutex::Unlock() will
   print trace information to stdout that can later be used by
   the deadlockfinder program (in the tests folder) to detect
   potential deadlocks in the code caused by inconsistent lock
   acquisition ordering.

-DMUSCLE_DEFAULT_RUNTIME_DISABLE_DEADLOCK_FINDER
   If this is specified in addition to -DMUSCLE_ENABLE_DEADLOCK_FINDER,
   then deadlock-detection will be compiled into the code but the
   printouts will be disabled by default.  To enable them at runtime,
   set the global variable _enableDeadlockFinderPrints to true.

-DMUSCLE_POOL_SLAB_SIZE
   This can be set to a number indicating the number of bytes that should be
   allocated in each "slab" of data malloc()'d by the ObjectPool class.  If left
   unset, slabs of approximately 8 kilobytes will be used.  Large slabs mean
   fewer memory allocations, but potentially more memory wasted if all the objects
   in the slabs aren't needed.  This value should be specified in bytes.

-DMUSCLE_AVOID_BITSTUFFING
   If set, this flag will cause the RefCount and ByteBuffer classes
   to use a separate boolean state value, rather than stuffing that bit
   into its held pointer.  This flag might be necessary on systems
   that don't word-align their object pointers (if such systems exist)

-DMUSCLE_AVOID_CHECK_THREAD_STACK_USAGE
   If set, calls to the CHECK_THREAD_STACK_USAGE macro will be
   converted into no-ops.

-DMUSCLE_AVOID_OBJECT_COUNTING
   If defined, the CountedObject<> class will compile down to a no-op.

-DMUSCLE_AVOID_THREAD_LOCAL_STORAGE
   If defined, the MUSCLE code will try to avoid using the ThreadLocalStorage
   class where possible (in particular, it will use Mutexes inside the
   ZLibUtilityFunctions.cpp file rather than ThreadLocalStorage objects --
   this might be useful on systems where ThreadLocalStorage isn't implemented)

-DMUSCLE_AVOID_MINIMIZED_HASHTABLES
   If defined, the MUSCLE Hashtable class will not used variable-sized
   indexing in its HashtableEntries.  Variable-sized indexing saves memory
   when tables have less than 65,535 slots in them, but increases the
   number of "if" statesments in common Hashtable codepaths.  Whether or
   not it increases or decreases performance will depend on the architecture
   of the host computer (e.g. on cache size, CPU speed, etc).

-DMUSCLE_AVOID_THREAD_SAFE_HASHTABLE_ITERATORS
   As of v5.90, the Hashtable class includes logic to ensure that
   HashtableIterators are thread safe, even if multiple threads are
   iterating over the same Hashtable at the same time (as long the
   Hashtable is not being modified, at least).  This extra safety
   does impose some overhead, though -- about 16 bytes of RAM per
   Hashtable object, and a small amount of CPU overhead imposed
   by using an AtomicCounter.  If you want to avoid that overhead
   and you're confident that you will always supply the 
   HTIT_FLAG_NOREGISTER argument whenever you are doing 
   concurrent iterations over a Hashtable (or Message), you can
   supply this flag on the command line to avoid the overhead.

-DMUSCLE_FAKE_SHARED_MEMORY
   If defined, the SharedMemory class will allocate a non-shared memory
   buffer (using muscleAlloc()) rather than actual shared memory.  Handy
   for debugging if you suspect that shared-memory is causing a problem.

-DMUSCLE_COUNT_STRING_COPY_OPERATIONS
   If this flag is defined, the String class will tally the number
   of times that String objects are moved and the number of times
   they are copied.  This is handy for verifying that the C++11
   move semantics are being used as expected.

-DMUSCLE_AVOID_XENOMAI
   Tells MUSCLE not to use Xenomai APIs, not even if 
   TARGET_PLATFORM_XENOMAI is defined.

-DDEBUG_LARGE_MEMORY_ALLOCATIONS_THRESHOLD=n
    If defined, whenever muscleAlloc() is called with a request size
    greater than (n), information about the allocation and a stack
    trace will be printed to stdout.  Good for quickly figuring out who 
    is allocating big contiguous chunks of memory.

-DMUSCLE_AVOID_AUTOCHOOSE_SWAP
    If set, MuscleSupport.h will define muscleSwap() the simple, 
    old-fashioned way.  This is less efficient, but avoiding the SFINAE
    mumbo-jumbo helps the code compile on older compilers (e.g. gcc 3.x)
    that don't handle SFINAE correctly.
