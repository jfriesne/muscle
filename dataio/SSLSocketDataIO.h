/** This class lets you communicate over a TCP socket with SSL encryption enabled on it.
  * @note In most cases when using this class you will want to wrap your MessageIOGateway
  *       in a SSLSocketAdapterGateway object; otherwise OpenSSL's internal state machine
  *       will not be able to work properly!
  * @note If you simply want to enable SSL on all your TCP connections, the easiest way
  *       to do that is to recompile MUSCLE with the -DMUSCLE_ENABLE_SSL compiler argument,
  *       and then call either SetSSLPublicKeyCertificate() or SetSSLPrivateKey() on your
  *       ReflectServer or MessageTransceiverThread object.  Then the MUSCLE event loop
  *       will transparently insert the SSL layer for you.  Alternatively, creating the
  *       SSLSocketDataIO objects and SSLSocketAdapterGateway objects explicitly in your
  *       own code will also work and may be necessary in cases where only certain sessions
  *       should use SSL.
