/** This class was contributed to the MUSCLE archive by Jonathon Padfield
  * (jpadfield@hotkey.net.au).  It's a good alternative to the QMessageTransceiverThread
  * class if you don't want to use the multi-threaded version of Qt.
  *
  * The QSocket object emits signals whenever it receives data, which you
  * can connect to your Muscle client. eg.
  *
  *  connect(muscleSocket, SIGNAL(hostFound()), SLOT(slotHostFound()));
  *  connect(muscleSocket, SIGNAL(connected()), SLOT(slotConnected()));
  *  connect(muscleSocket, SIGNAL(readyRead()), SLOT(slotReadyRead()));
  *  connect(muscleSocket, SIGNAL(bytesWritten(int)), SLOT(slotBytesWritten(int)));
  *
  * You can then use the normal QSocket routines to connect to the server
  * while running all the input through the MessageIO interface.
