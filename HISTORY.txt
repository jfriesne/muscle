key:  - new feature
      * bug fixed
      o other

6.20
   - Added a new sub-folder besupport/admin_gui.  It contains
     Fredrik Mod√©en's GUI shell for more easily running muscled
     under BeOS or Haiku.
   - Added new MUSCLE-specific versions of some potentially-insecure
     (per Microsoft) C functions to MuscleSupport.h:  muscleFopen(),
     muscleStrcpy(), muscleStrncpy(), muscleSprintf(), and
     muscleSnprintf().  These get expanded out to the appropriate
     system-specific equivalent, so that e.g. under Windows we can
     use the CRT-secure Windows-only equivalents, while not having
     to put #ifdefs all over the code to keep it compiling elsewhere.
   o MUSCLE classes that should not be subclasses are now tagged
     with the MUSCLE_FINAL_CLASS keyword so that when compiled
     with -DMUSCLE_USE_CPLUSPLUS11 the compiler will produce a
     compile-time error if they are subclassed.
   o Modified the QueueGatewayMessageReceiver and StringMatcherQueue
     classes to no longer subclass from the Queue class, since
     subclassing from Queue is no longer allowed.  Instead, they
     now include a Queue object as a member variable and provide
     accessors to that object.
   o Replaced various of the aforementioned calls with their
     muscle*() equivalents in the codebase.
   o Merged in some patches contributed by Mika Linqvist to avoid
     CRT security warnings when compiling under MSVC 2013.
   o Removed all calls to strcat() and strncat(), as their string
     truncation semantics are too difficult for me to reason about
     reliably.  The rewritten code is also generally more efficient.
   o Modified DefaultFileLogger::CloseLogFile() to reduce its
     stack usage.
   * Fixed a const-correctness problem in ConvertMessages.cpp.
   * Removed a compiler warning (from SysLog.cpp) about
     GetVersionA() not working usefully under Windows 8 and higher.
   * Applied Mika Lindqvist's patch to fix some potential
     memory leaks in regcomp.c

6.12 Released 4/6/2015
   - The Python message_transceiver_thread class will now
     fall back to connecting via IPv4 if the supplied hostname
     cannot be expanded to an IPv6 address (and vice versa).
   o Added a NotCopyable base class to various classes
     (Socket, DataNode, AbstractReflectSession, etc) so that
     the compiler will verify that they are not being copied.
   o The StringMatcher class now interprets any simple wildcard
     string starting with a backtick character (`) as indicating
     a non-simple regex string.  That way it is possible to use
     the standard regex functionality, if desired, in contexts
     that otherwise provide no way to indicate that a string
     is meant to be a full regex string and not a simple wildcard
     string (e.g. in MUSCLE subscription strings)
   o Tweaked the codebase to get rid of a number of style
     problems and minor errors that were reported by cppcheck.
   * Added a patch to the captive regex library to fix a
     potential int32-overrun in regcomp().  Thanks to Mika
     Lindqvist for supplying me with the patch.
   * Merged in some patches from Mika Lindqvist to avoid
     some warnings when compiling in a 64-bit environment.

6.11 Released 2/2/2015
   - When compiled under Windows, SetupSystem.cpp now contains
     #pragma commands so that necessary Windows-libraries will
     be automatically linked in.  This means the user no longer
     has to spend time chasing down so many linker errors when
     setting up a new project file.
   o MutexGuard's argument is now a const reference, since
     Mutex::Lock() and Mutex::Unlock() are const methods.
   o Removed AbstractReflectSession::GetDefaultHostName()
     and replaced it with a new method named
     AbstractReflectSession::GenerateHostName().  The new
     method lets the session subclass choose a custom
     hostname for the session even if the IP address
     determination didn't fail.
   o Added some private/unimplemented method overloads for
     MessageTransceiverThread::AddNewConnectSession() and
     QMessageTransceiverHandler::SetupAsNewConnectSession()
     so that if the caller tries to call these methods
     with timeout-values but forgets to include the
     (expandLocalhost) argument, the error will be caught
     at compile-time rather than causing unexpected run-time
     behavior.

6.10 Released 12/12/2014
   - The DetectNetworkConfigChangesSession class now has
     ComputerIsAboutToSleep() and ComputerJustWokeUp()
     callback methods that are called at the times indicated
     by their names.  Currently this functionality is
     implemented only under MacOS/X and Windows.
   o Added work-arounds for gcc-3.x SFINAE incompatibilities
     to MuscleSupport.h
   o Updated the muscle.dox file using doxygen -u so that
     it is now up-to-date (as of DOxygen 1.8.8)
   * If a string like "for 10 seconds" was passed to
     ParseHumanReadableTimeIntervalString(), the "for"
     prefix would cause the returned value to be twice
     what it was expected to be.  Fixed.

6.09 Released 11/3/2014
   - Added a (preferIPv6) argument to GetHostByName().  If
     left as true (the default value), GetHostByName() will
     prefer to return an IPv6 address over an IPv4 address.
   - Added support for a DEBUG_LARGE_MEMORY_ALLOCATIONS_THRESHOLD
     compiler-flag into GlobalMemoryAllocator.cpp.  When this
     flag is set to a value (in bytes), any memory allocations
     greater than the value will result in a message and a stack
     trace being printed to stdout.
   - When MUSCLE_USE_CPLUSPLUS11 is defined, the PODHashFunctor
     class will provoke a compile-time error if the program tries to
     use a struct or class as a KeyType in a Hashtable and the
     struct/class does not have a "uint32 HashCode const" method
     defined.  (Previously the code would compile without error, and
     then hashing errors would occur at runtime due to the object's
     padding bytes being uninitialized)
   * The MCRASH() macro now calls abort() rather than assert(false),
     so that a crash will actually occur, even if the code was
     compiled with -DNDEBUG.
   o The Windows implementation of MCRASH() now calls RaiseException(),
     so that the crash will behave more like an actual caused-by-a-bug
     crash (in particular, a Windows Structured Exception will be raised)
   o Updated SendDataUDP() to work around a "feature" in OS/X 10.10 (aka
     Yosemite) that causes setsockopt(fd, IPPROTO_IPV6, IPV6_MULTICAST_IF)
     to fail when setting the socket's interface-index value back to 0.

6.08 Released 10/10/2014
   - Added a ShrinkToFit() convenience method to the Queue,
     Hashtable, and String classes.  This method shrinks the
     object so that the amount of memory it has allocated internally
     matches the size of the data it is actually holding.
   - Hashtable::EnsureSize() and Queue::EnsureSize() now take an optional
     (allowShrink) argument, that (if set to true) allows the object's
     internally-allocated array to be reallocated smaller if it is larger
     than necessary.
   o Tweaked the buffer-expansion behavior of the String class to
     be a bit more efficient.
   * Added a guard against a potential infinite recursion that
     could occur while logging an "OUT OF MEMORY" error after
     a memory allocation failure, if a LogCallback tried to
     allocate memory.

6.07 Released 9/18/2014
   - Added a GlobalPrintRecyclersToStream() method to the
     AbstractObjectRecycler class, for better debugging and
     analysis of the ObjectPool's memory usage.
   - Added an abstract PrintToStream() method to the
     AbstactObjectRecycler class, and a concrete implementation
     of that method to the ObjectPool and ThreadPool classes.
   - Added a testobjectpool.cpp test program to the tests
     folder, as a quick sanity check for the ObjectPool class.
   - Java performance improvement from Bryan Varner: Switched to a
     direct byte buffer, which is allocated by the OS outside of
     the GC's managed space.
   - Java performance improvement from Bryan Varner: Scoped the
     receiving byte buffer to the receiver, which cut down on a
     lot of time spent allocating short-lived buffers.
   - Java performance improvement from Bryan Varner: Added a
     constructor for the MessageReceiver to allocate it's buffer
     to the same size as the sockets underlying buffer and made
     use of the call where possible.
   - Added a GetObjectClassName() method to the ObjectPool class.
   - The GetNetworkInterfaceInfos() function now supports a new
     bit named GNII_INCLUDE_UNADDRESSED_INTERFACES, which tells
     it to return even network interfaces with no IP address.
   - The default value of the (includeBits) argument to
     GetNetworkInterfaceInfos() is now GNII_INCLUDE_ALL_ADDRESSED_INTERFACES
     rather than GNII_INCLUDE_ALL_INTERFACES, to reflect the nuance
     that was added above; the default behavior is unchanged, though.
   - When -DMUSCLE_USE_CPLUSPLUS11 is defined, muscleMin() and
     muscleMax() now use variadic templates so that they can
     accept any number of arguments (rather than just up to five).
   o Java fix from Bryan Varner:  Updated the handling code for
     NotEnoughDataExceptions to no longer rely on the position of
     the buffer (but rather look at the buffer limit, or the amount
     previously read into the buffer) -- which basically makes the
     above change unnecessary, but I'm paranoid.
   o Changed the Message, Queue, Hashtable, and String classes so
     that when they are set equal to an empty/default object, they
     now free any large dynamically-allocated buffer they may be holding.
     This avoids excessive memory usage by objects that have been
     returned to an ObjectPool after being used to hold large amounts
     of data.
   o Modified muscleMin(), muscleMax(), muscleSgn(), muscleClamp(),
     and musclAbs() to take arguments and return by value rather
     than by const-reference.
   * Java fix from Bryan Varner:  Fixed a bug causing communication
     failures in the NIO message unflattening.
   * Java fix from Bryan Varner:  Prior to throwing a
     NotEnoughDataException the position of the buffer wasn't
     being updated in MessageIOGateway and JZLibMessageIOGateway.

6.06 Released 8/15/2014
   - ParseHumanReadableTimeIntervalString() can now parse strings
     where only the time-unit is specified.  (e.g. "second" now
     returns 1000000)
   - Added GetInternalThreadPulseTime(), InternalThreadPulse(),
     WriteToMainThread(), and ShutdownInternalThread() methods
     to the AsyncDataIO class, so that it can be subclassed for
     use in impersonating a "live" socket, using test data
     internally generated inside its I/O thread.
   o Added code to testbytebuffer.cpp, so that if a filename is
     passed as an argument, the contents of the specified file
     will be printed to stdout in annotated-hex format.
   o Added support for a -DMUSCLE_AVOID_XENOMAI flag, to be used
     when compiling with -DTARGET_PLATFORM_XENOMAI but we don't
     want MUSCLE to use Xenomai anyway.
   * Merged in Augustin Cavalier's patch to get MUSCLE to
     compile again under Haiku.
   * Modified the Queue code to avoid a static-analyizer warning.
   * Fixed a valgrind hit in AbstractReflectSession::Reconnect().
   * Fixed a bug in AsyncDataIO that would cause it to hang
     when being shut down.
   * Fixed a bug that could cause a QueryFilter's replacement
     ConstMessageRef object to be ignored in certain circumstances.

6.05 Released 6/27/2014
   - Upgraded the captive zlib implementation to v1.2.8.
   o Moved public repository from FreeCode to GitHub, because
     FreeCode no longer accepts release announcements.
   o Renamed LICENSE.txt to LICENSE, since that's how GitHub
     likes the license file to be named.
   * Merged in Mika Lindqvist's patch to avoid some truncation
     warnings for strlen() calls under 64-bit Visual C++.

6.04 Released 6/11/2014
   - Added a public GetParametersConst() method to the
     StorageReflectSession, for easier debugging.
   * Fixed a bug that prevented the PR_COMMAND_REMOVEPARAMETERS
     handler from removing parameters that had escaped wildcard
     characters in their names.

6.03 Released 6/2/2014
   - Added a convenience method muscleArrayIndexIsValid() that
     returns true iff the specified numeric index is a valid index
     into the specified array.
   - Added a CloseCurrentLogFile() function that can be used to
     force the file-logger to close any log file that it currently
     has open.
   - Added a SetSendDestinations() method to the UDPSocketDataIO
     class, for convenience.
   - The Launch*() and System*() methods in the ChildProcessDataIO
     class now take an optional directory-path argument so that you
     can specify the current working directory of the child process.
   - Added move-constructors and move-assignment operators to the
     Ref and ConstRef classes (available only when
     MUSCLE_USE_CPLUSPLUS11 is defined, of course).
   - Added a Reset() method to the PointerAndBool class.
   - Added a SwapContents() method to the PointerAndBool class.
   - Added RemoveHeadMulti() and RemoveTailMulti() convenience
     methods to the Queue class.
   o Queue::GetArrayPointer() now makes sure to set (retLength)
     to 0 when it returns NULL.
   * Under Windows, GetConstSocketRefFromPool() now automatically
     sets the don't-inherit flag on any sockets passed to it.  This
     avoids problems caused by child processes unintentionally holding
     sockets connections open in the parent process.
   * Fixed a bug in Queue::EnsureSizeAux() that would cause a
     bogus extra item to be added to the end of the Queue if the
     (setNumItems) argument was set to true.
   * The MacOS/X implementation of DetectNetworkConfigChangesSession
     would fail to notify its calling code about a changed network
     configuration if the network change did not include any
     IP address changes.  Now it does provide a notification
     for that scenario as well.

6.02 Released 4/2/2014
   - Added optional (addHeaderBytes) and (addFooterBytes) arguments
     to the DeflateByteBuffer() utility functions.
   - Added an implementation of GetByteBufferFromPool() that takes
     a DataIO as an argument, for easy reading in of files, etc.
   - Added a NybbleizeData() implementation that takes a pointer
     and length argument rather than a ByteBuffer object.
   - Added an AreKeySetsEqual() convenience method to the Hashtable
     class.  This method checks for equal key-sets while ignoring
     the values in the two Hashtables.
   - Added WithoutPrefixIgnoreCase() and WithoutSuffixIgnoreCase()
     convenience methods to the String class.
   - Added some missing convenience overloads for HexBytesToString().
   - CanWildcardStringMatchMultipleValues() now ignores dashes in the
     string, since they only have meaning when enclosed in brackets --
     and if there are brackets in the string, those will be sufficient
     to cause CanWildcardStringMatchMultipleValues() to return true.
   o Renamed CanRegexStringMatchMultipleValues() to
     CanWildcardStringMatchMultipleValues(), as it is really examining
     the simplified wild-card syntax and not the official regex
     syntax.
   o Several locations that were calling HasRegexTokens() to decide
     if it was worth doing pattern-matching with a key-string now
     call CanWildcardStringMatchMultipleValues() instead.
   o DataNode::Reset() now deletes any metadata structures the
     DataNode may have accumulated, rather than simply clearing them.
     This saves RAM, and also ensures that recycled DataNodes will
     act exactly the same as newly created ones.
   * The MemMem() function did not return correct results in all
     cases.  Rewrote it to work correctly.

6.01 Released 1/7/2014
   - Added a PrependWord() convenience method to the String class.
   - Added WithReplacements() convenience methods to the String class.
   - Added a SetExplicitDelayMicros() method to the
     DetectNetworkConfigChangesSession class.
   - Added a IsCopperDetected() method to the NetworkInterfaceInfo
     class, so that code can tell whether or not a Ethernet jack
     has a cable plugged in to it.
   - Added a "quietsend" argument to hexterm.
   o The NetworkInterfacesChanged() virtual method
     in the DetectNetworkConfigChangesSession class
     has been changed to take an argument that calls out
     which network interfaces in particular have changed.
     This functionality is currently only implemented under
     Linux, MacOS/X and Windows.  For other OS's the
     argument will always be an empty list.
   * Fixed a bug in the Linux implementation of
     DetectNetworkConfigChangesSession that could cause
     a segmentation fault if recvmsg() returned an error
     (e.g. due to a signal being received).

6.00 Released 10/14/2013
   - Rewrote the SSLSocketDataIO class to work better
     with non-blocking I/O (in conjunction with the
     new SSLSocketAdapterGateway class).
   - Added implementations of SSLSocketDataIO::SetPrivateKey()
     and SSLSocketDataIO::SetCertificate() that take a
     ByteBuffer as an argument.
   - Added an SSLSocketAdapterGateway class that is used
     to manage OpenSSL's internal state machine when using
     an SSLSocketDataIO class with your gateway.
   - Added SetSSLPrivateKey() and GetSSLPrivateKey() methods
     to the ReflectServer class, for easier enabling of SSL
     authentication on all incoming TCP connections.  These
     methods are available iff MUSCLE_ENABLE_SSL is defined.
   - Added SetSSLPublicKeyCertificate() and GetSSLPublicKeyCertificate()
     methods to the ReflectServer class, for easier enabling
     of SSL authentication on outgoing TCP connections.  These
     methods are available iff MUSCLE_ENABLE_SSL is defined.
   - Added SetSSLPrivateKey() and SetSSLPublicKeyCertificate()
     methods to the MessageTransceiverThread class, for easier
     enabling of SSL functionality when using threaded I/O.
   - Added an ssl_data folder with some info on generating
     OpenSSL public/private keypairs, and an example keypair
     for use in testing OpenSSL.
   - When MUSCLE_ENABLE_SSL is defined, muscled now accepts
     an optional 'privatekey=filename' argument.  When specified,
     SSL mode will be enabled and muscled will only accept incoming
     TCP connections that present public keys that match this
     private key/certificate.
   - When MUSCLE_ENABLE_SSL is defined, portablereflectclient
     and qt_example will now accept an optional
     'publickey=filename' argument.  When specified, SSL mode
     will be enabled and these clients will connect to muscled
     using OpenSSL and present this file as their credentials.
   - Added an "Animate" checkbox to the qt_example demo.
     Checking it causes the window to move its indicator around
     automatically.  This is fun and also useful if you want to
     test a scenario where multiple clients are generating traffic
     simultaneously.
   - Made the qt_example demo prettier.
   - Renamed the C++11-helper macros in Hashtable.h and Queue.h
     to make them less likely to collide with other packages' macros.
   * Fixed some minor errors in the SSLSocketDataIO class.
   o Renamed SSLSocketDataIO::SetKey() to SetPrivateKey().
   o Renamed SSLSocketDataIO::SetCertificate() to
     SetPublicKeyCertificate().
   o AbstractMessageIOGateway::SetDataIO() is now a virtual
     method.

5.92 Released 9/20/2013
   - Improved support for C++11 move-semantics in the
     Queue and Hashtable classes (enabled only when
     -DMUSCLE_USE_CPLUSPLUS11 is defined)
   - Added some instrumentation to the String class so
     I can watch how many times a String object is copied, moved,
     etc (enabled only when -DMUSCLE_COUNT_STRING_COPY_OPERATIONS
     is defined)
   - Added a PrintAndClearStringCopyCounts() function which
     will print out the String-operation data collected above.
   - Added some SFINAE magic to muscleSwap() so that it will
     swap by calling SwapContents() when possible, rather than
     by copying to a temporary object.
   - Added an initializer-list constructor and overload of
     AddTailMulti() to the Queue class (available only when
     -DMUSCLE_USE_CPLUSPLUS11 is defined, of course)
   o Renamed the Queue and array overloads of Queue::AddTail()
     to AddTailMulti(), to avoid conflicts with the new C++11
     template parsing support.
   o Renamed the Queue and array overloads of Queue::AddHead()
     to AddHeadMulti(), to avoid conflicts with the new C++11
     template parsing support.
   o Replaced MCRASH_IMPL macro with a call to assert(false).
   * A little more Android-compatibility tweakage.
   * Many of the programs in the tests folder weren't compiling
     under C++11.  Fixed.
   * Fixed several potential bugs that were detected by clang's
     static analysis tool.

5.91 Released 9/2/2013
   - Added EnsureCanPut() convenience method to the Hashtable class.
   - Added EnsureCanAdd() convenience method to the Queue class.
   o Changed DoMutexAtomicIncrement() to be an inline function to
     make calling it more efficient.
   * Changed QMessageTransceiverThread and QAcceptSocketsThread to
     call QCoreApplication::postEvent() rather than
     QApplication::postEvent(), to allow for non-GUI Qt apps.
   * Updated the Beginner's Guide document to reflect MUSCLE's
     improved UDP support.
   * Merged in some Android compatibility changes provided by
     Jean-Fran√ßois Mullet.
   * Use of the MUSCLE_USE_MUTEXES_FOR_ATOMIC_OPERATIONS compile
     flag would cause MUSCLE to crash on startup due to an
     order-of-operations issue.  This has been fixed now.
   * The MUSCLE_USE_MUTEXES_FOR_ATOMIC_OPERATIONS compile flag
     was previously only used if no other implementation of
     AtomicCounter was available.  Now the flag has higher
     precedence, so setting the flag means that Mutexes will
     be used, even if another (more efficient) mechanism is
     available.

5.90 Released 8/6/2013
   - Added a GetPacketMaximumSize() method to the DataIO class
     to allow gateway code to more intelligently handle UDP-style
     packetized communication.
   - MessageIOGateway now works usefully in conjunction with
     UDPSocketDataIO.
   - Added CreateObjectFromArchiveMessage() templated functions
     to Message.h, to serve as a restoring-side counterpart to
     GetArchiveMessageFromPool(), etc.
   - AtomicCounter::AtomicIncrement() now returns a boolean
     (true iff the new counter value is equal to one).
   - Modified the HashtableIterator class so that read-only
     Hashtable iterations are now thread-safe even if the
     HTIT_FLAG_NOREGISTER flag isn't specified.
   - Added a muscle_thread_id class to SetupSystem.h, to
     properly represent a thread ID in an
     implementation-neutral fashion.
   - Added a "deadlock" program to the tests folder.  This
     program deliberately risks creating a deadlock, as a way
     to exercise/demonstrate the deadlockfinder test.
   - Added support for a -DMUSCLE_AVOID_THREAD_SAFE_HASHTABLE_ITERATORS
     command line flag, for those who would rather avoid the
     overhead of automatic thread safety and promise to supply
     HTIT_FLAG_NOREGISTER arguments by hand where necessary.
   - Added an optional LRU lookup cache to the GetHostByName()
     function, so that it can return more quickly when the same
     hostnames are getting resolved over and over again.
   - Added a SetHostNameCacheSettings() function that enables
     and adjusts the LRU lookup cache in GetHostByName().
   - Added support for "dnscache" and "dnscachesize" command
     line arguments in HandleStandardDaemonArgs(), to allow
     command-line specification of the LRU lookup cache's behavior.
   o Modified the Hashtable class so that the _iterHead, _iterTail,
     and _freeHead member values are now uint32s rather than
     pointers, to reduce memory usage.
   o Removed the ThreadLocalStorage::SetFreeHeldObjectsOnExit()
     method, and added a boolean argument to its constructor
     instead, since pthreads don't allow you to change that
     setting after pthread_key_create() has been called.
   o Moved GetCurrentThreadID() into the muscle_thread_id class
     as a static member function, and changed it to return
     a muscle_thread_id object rather than unsigned long.
   o Changed the default hostname for sessions without a known
     IP address from "<unknown>" to "_unknown_", as the angle
     brackets in the former string have a special meaning as of
     the 5.84 release, and that could interfere with node-path
     matching in unintended ways.
   o The CalculateChecksum() methods in Message.cpp have been
     modified to be more robust in detecting data transposition
     differences.
   o Removed the MUSCLE_USE_QT_FOR_ATOMIC_OPERATIONS support
     from AtomicCounter.h, since Qt's QAtomicInt class doesn't
     support the functionality that the AtomicIncrement()
     method's new return value requires.
   o Removed MessageIOGateway::FlattenMessage() and
     MessageIOGateway::UnflattenMessage().  Added in their
     place:  MessageIOGateway::FlattenHeaderAndMessage()
     and MessageIOGateway::UnflattenHeaderAndMessage().
     These new methods deal with both the header bytes and
     the Message body at the same time.
   o Added a udpproxy.vcproj file to the tests folder, to
     help compile udpproxy under Windows.
   o Message:Flatten() now iterates over the fields in the
     Message once, instead of twice.
   o GetCurrentThreadID() is now an inline function, since
     it may now get called often by HashtableIterator.
   o Modified the deadlockfinder code to use Queues instead
     of Hashtables, since muscle_thread_id can't be used
     as a Hashtable key type anymore.
   * Fixed testudp.cpp to properly use a MessageIOGateway
     for its UDP communication.
   * Tweaked the ifdefs in FilePathInfo.cpp a bit more so that
     statInfo.st_birthtimespec won't be accessed when using
     MacOS/X SDKs that don't provide it.
   * MessageDataIOGateway no longer tries to Unflatten a
     Message from a zlib-deflated data buffer that it was
     unable re-inflate.
   * Fixed a bug in SendDataUDP() that could cause SendDataUDP()
     to incorrectly return an error when sending to a multicast
     address using non-blocking mode, and the output buffer was
     full.

5.85 Released 7/2/2013
   - Added LogTime(MUSCLE_LOG_DEBUG) calls to all the error paths
     in MessageIOGateway::DoInputImplementation() and
     Message::Unflatten(), so that it's easier to determine when
     TCP connections are being aborted due to data corruption.
   - Added a PreviousOperationHadTransientFailure() function,
     which returns true iff errno is EINTR or ENOBUFS.
   - Specifying spamspersecond=-1 will now cause hexterm to
     send spam data as fast as possible.
   o SocketMultiplexer.h's MUSCLE_USE_POLL implementation was
     supplying POLLERR to WSAPoll() but WSAPoll() doesn't support
     POLLERR so WSAPoll() would return an error when this occurred.
     Worked around the problem by filtering out POLLERR when
     compiling under Windows.
   * Fixed a bug where send() returning ENOBUFS could cause the
     socket connection to be terminated, even though ENOBUFS is
     not a fatal condition.
   * SocketMultiplexer.cpp would not compile when MUSCLE_USE_POLL
     was defined.  Fixed.
   * The ZLibCodec::Deflate() method would fail to compress all
     the data in a very large buffer (e.g. over 42MB).  Fixed.

5.84 Released 4/20/2013
   - The StringMatcher class's numeric-range syntax has been
     extended so that you can now specify multiple ranges.
     For example, "<19-21,25,30-50>" would match strings
     "19", "20", "21", "25", "30", "31", [...], and "50".
   - Added GetCurrentTime64ForRunTime64() and GetRunTime64ForCurrenTime64()
     conversion functions to TimeUtilityFunctions.h.
   - Added a GetDescendant() utility method to the DataNode class.
   - Added C++11 move-constructors and move-assignment-operators
     to the Hashtable, Queue, String, Message, and ByteBuffer classes.
     For backwards compatibility with older compilers, this code
     will only be compiled if -DMUSCLE_USE_CPLUSPLUS11 is specified
     on the compile line.
   - SharedMemory class will now nerf itself into a non-shared-memory
     class if -DMUSCLE_FAKE_SHARED_MEMORY is specified.
   - Added a testfilepathinfo test to the tests folder.
   o Updated all copyright notice headers to read 2000-2013 Meyer Sound.
   * Added spaces between macro tokens (e.g. UINT32_FORMAT_SPEC) and
     string constants (e.g. "Hello") to make C++11 compilers happy.
   * ByteBuffer.cpp had a syntax error that would prevent it from
     compiling on big-endian hosts.  Fixed.
   * MacOS/X only:  Replaced deprecated Carbon function calls with
     Mach equivalents, to avoid deprecation warnings under 10.8.x.

5.83 Released 11/11/2012
   - Added convenience versions of InflateByteBuffer() and
     DeflateByteBuffer() that take a ByteBufferRef as an argument.
   o Removed some obsolete/unused methods (EnsureBufferSize() and
     FreeLargeBuffer()) from the AbstractMessageIOGateway class.
   o Fixed some typos in the comments in the delphi subfolder.
   * The Hashtable class no longer generates warnings when compiled
     under MSVC with -DMUSCLE_AVOID_MINIMIZED_HASHTABLES defined.
   * Fixed a bug in IPAddressAndPort::ToString() that caused IPv4
     address strings to be formatted ambiguously when (preferIPv4Style)
     was set to false.

5.82 Released 10/1/2012
   - Rewrote the Hashtable class so that it now saves memory by
     internally using smaller per-slot index values (e.g. uint8 or
     uint16, rather than uint32) in Hashtables with fewer than 65,535
     slots in their HashtableEntry-array.
   - Added support for compiling with -DMUSCLE_AVOID_MINIMIZED_HASHTABLES,
     which will disable the above optimization (since sometimes you'd
     rather use more memory and have faster code execution)
   * Fixed ZLibUtilityFunctions.cpp so that it will again build when
     -DMUSCLE_SINGLE_THREAD_ONLY is defined.

5.81 Released 9/13/2012
   - If compiled with -DMUSCLE_ENABLE_DEADLOCK_FINDER,
     HandleStandardDaemonArgs() will now look for a "deadlockfinder"
     argument that can be used to force deadlock-prints on or off.
   - Rewrote the ZLibUtilityFunctions.cpp calls to use
     ThreadLocalStorage rather than shared ZLibCodec objects
     serialized by Mutexes.  This change helps avoids any possibility
     of deadlocks, and also improves performance because now multiple
     threads can inflate and/or deflate data in parallel.  For systems
     without a ThreadLocalStorage implementation, the old
     implementation can still be used as a fallback, by compiling with
     -DMUSCLE_AVOID_THREAD_LOCAL_STORAGE.
   - The pthreads implementation of the ThreadLocalStorage now uses
     the destructor-callback feature of pthread_create_key() to ensure
     that created thread-local-data objects are destroyed in a timely
     manner (i.e. when their host thread exits, rather than only when
     the ThreadLocalStorage object destructor runs)
   o ParseHexBytes() no longer treats commas as token-separator
     characters, that way they can be escaped (by prefixing them
     with a slash) and entered as ASCII literals.

5.80 Release 8/30/2012
   - Added a new "micromessage" folder that contains a C API
     with functions for constructing and parsing Message data
     directly to/from its flattened form, with no intermediate
     representations, flattening/unflattening, or dynamic memory
     allocation necessary.  This API would be appropriate for
     embedded or other severely constrained environments.
   - Added "testmicro", "microchatclient", and "microreflectclient"
     programs to the tests folder, to serve as tests and examples
     for the new MicroMessage and MicroMessageGateway APIs.
   - Added a new constructor to the FilePathInfo class that
     allows explicit/manual setting of the file info parameters.
   - Added MoveName*() methods to the Message class, so that
     the iteration order of the fields in the Message can
     be easily modified.
   o Made String::Flatten(), String::Unflattened(), and
     String::FlattenedSize() into inline methods.
   * IsMulticastIPAddress() now returns true for IPv6-mapped
     IPv4 multicast addresses (e.g. ::ffff:239.255.1.2)
   * Fixed a bug in MutexGuard class declaration, private
     copy-constructor had wrong argument type.
   * Fixed some inaccurate comments in ZipUtilityFunctions.h
   * Fixed the "chatclient" test; it was forgetting to read
     from stdin.

5.72 Released 6/27/2012
   - Added HexBytesToAnnotatedString() functions to the
     MiscUtilityFunctions API.  These are similar to
     PrintHexBytes(), but they output to a String rather
     than to a file.
   - ParseHumanReadableTimeIntervalString now correctly parses
     non-integral values (e.g. "3.5 minutes")
   * Fixed a constant-overflow error in testbytebuffer.cpp
   * Fixed the gcc implementation of MuscleX86SwapInt16(),
     which would fail to compile under gcc 4.7 on 64 bit targets.
   * Usage of the uintptr typedef no longer causes warnings under
     MSVC when the /Wp64 compiler flag is specified.
   * Cleaned up some other miscellaneous MSVC warnings.

5.71 Released 6/11/2012
   - Added a WasSignalCaught() function to SignalHandlerSession.h.
     This method will return true iff any SignalHandlerSession ever
     caught a signal in the current process.
   - Added global SetMainReflectServerCatchSignals() and
     GetMainReflectServerCatchSignals() functions to
     SignalHandlerSession.h to allow easy programmatic enabling
     and disabling of the standard signal handling routines.
   - Added WithPrefix(), WithSuffix(), WithoutPrefix(), and
     WithoutSuffix() convenience methods to the String class.
   - Added TruncateChars() and TruncateToLength() convenience
     methods to the String class.
   - Added an StartsWithNumber() convenience method to the String class.
   - Added Append*(), Read*(), and Write*() methods to the ByteBuffer
     class for easier endian-aware adding and retrieiving of various
     primitive datatypes from a ByteBuffer's data array.
   - Added a SetDataFlags() and IsEndianSwapEnabled() methods to
     the ByteBuffer class to help the user specify what data
     endian-ness logic the ByteBuffer should apply in its Append*(),
     Read*(), and Write*() method calls.
   - Added a testbytebuffer.cpp test to the tests folder to test
     the new data adding/retrieval routines.
   - Added a PointerAndBool class that stores a pointer and a boolean
     using no more space than that of a pointer by itself (unless
     -DMUSCLE_AVOID_BITSTUFFING is enabled).
   o Renamed MUSCLE_AVOID_REFCOUNT_BITSTUFFING to
     MUSCLE_AVOID_BITSTUFFING, since bit-stuffing is no longer
     specific to the RefCount class.

5.70 Released 5/8/2012
   - NodePathMatcher::DoTraversal() now returns the number of
     DataNodes that the traversal visited.
   * Fixed a bug in Queue::Clear() that would cause it only to reset
     the first item in the queue rather than all of the items.
   * Range-checking in DenybblizeData was incorrect (it would spuriously
     reject characters 'G' through 'P').  Fixed.

5.69 Released 4/18/2012
   - Made Queue::Clear() a bit more efficient.
   - Exposed the DefaultConsoleLogger and DefaultFileLogger
     classes in LogCallback.h so they can be re-used elsewhere.
   - Added an Indent() convenience method to the String class.
   - The matching logic in AndOrQueryFilter and NandNotQueryFilter
     now has additional short-circuit logic for better efficiency.
   - StorageReflectSession::RestoreNodeTreeFromMessage() now
     has an optional (quiet) argument, which can be used to prevent
     db-subscription-updates from being triggered when the subtree
     is installed into the database.
   o Rewrote the String::Arg() methods to take C-native argument
     types rather than fixed-size types (e.g. int instead of int32)
     so that explicit typecasting is no longer required to avoid
     ambiguous-argument-type compile errors that previously could
     occur under certain compilers.
   o Tweaked the .pro files in the qtsupport folders to make them
     compatible with Qt 5.0.
   o DenybbleizeData() now returns B_ERROR when passed a string
     with an invalid (odd) length, rather than causing an
     assertion failure.
   * Inet_NtoA() now formats IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses in the
     IPv4 style, if (preferIPv4Style) is set to true.
   * Merged in more Haiku-compatibility fixes provided by Fredrik.

5.68 Released 3/23/2012
   - Added an optional (retPort) argument to GetPeerIPAddress().
   - Added optional "spamspersecond" and "spamsize" arguments to
     hexterm, so that you can have hexterm automatically generate
     random output at a specified rate for performance testing.
   - Added a "quietreceive" argument to hexterm so that if you
     don't want to see a printout of the bytes being received,
     you don't have to.
   - Added GetDistanceTo() and GetSquaredDistanceTo() methods
     to the Point class.
   o Privileged-address matching is now done using IPv4-style
     address strings for IPv4 addresses (even when compiled with
     IPv6 support enabled), per Lior's request.
   * Merged in some Haiku-compatibility fixes provided by
     Fredrik Modeen.

5.67 Released 2/3/2012
   - Added a AreOutgoingMessagesIndependent() method to the
     MessageIOGateway class, to allow better control over how
     outgoing Messages are deflated when zlib-encoding is enabled.
   - Removed some unnecessary data members from certain Message
     field-object classes, to cut down on memory usage.
   - Added a Queue::GetItemAtUnchecked() method.
   - Added a RemoveName() to the Python Message class.
   o Cleaned up the Python code to avoid pychecker warnings
   o Removed Queue::GetItemPointer().  Use Queue::GetItemAt() instead.
   * BitChord::ToHexString() was broken -- fixed.
   * Queue::GetItemAt() would return a garbage pointer if passed
     an invalid index.  Fixed to return NULL (as documented) instead.
   * Fixed a problem in QSignalHandler and QDataIODevice that could
     occasionally cause a CPU-spin on shutdown under MacOSX/Lion.

5.66 Released 1/5/2012
   - Added a CountedRawDataMessageIOGateway class to
     RawDataMessageIOGateway.{cpp,h}.  This class is the same as
     its RawDataMessageIOGateway superclass, except that it is
     instrumented to keep a running count of the number of raw
     data bytes currently held in its output-queue.
   - Added a CountedMessageIOGateway class to MessageIOGateway.{cpp,h}.
     This is similar to the CountedRawDataMessageIOGateway class
     described above, except it tracks Message sizes.
   - Added a PopNextOutgoingMessage() virtual method to the
     MessageIOGateway class, so that subclasses can override its
     behavior if necessary.
   - Added EventLoopCycleBegins() and EventLoopCycleEnds()
     virtual method hooks to the ReflectServer class.
   o AbstractMessageIOGateway::AddOutgoingMessage() is now virtual.
   o Trying to use -DMUSCLE_USE_POLL under Windows without declaring
     an appropriate value for -DWIN32_WINNT now gives an informative
     compile-error message rather than the inscrutible errors that
     would appear previously.
   * Fixed minor bug in kqueue that could cause obsolete entries
     to remain in the _bits Hashtable.
   * Fixed a bug in the RawDataMessageIOGateway class that would cause
     it to emit Messages with a what-code of 0 (rather than
     PR_COMMAND_RAW_DATA) when in immediate-forward mode.

5.65 Released 12/22/2011
   - Added experimental support for kqueue under FreeBSD/MacOSX,
     enabled by defining -DMUSCLE_USE_KQUEUE on the compile line.
   - Added experimental support for epoll under Linux
     enabled by defining -DMUSCLE_USE_EPOLL on the compile line.
   - Updated testsocketmultiplexer.cpp to make it more useful for
     gathering performance statistics for the various SocketMultiplexer
     implementations.

5.64 Released 12/13/2011
   - Added a SocketMultiplexer class (util/SocketMultiplexer.{cpp,h})
     that acts as an API-agnostic wrapper around select() or poll(),
     depending on whether MUSCLE_USE_POLL is defined or not.
   - MuscleSupport.h now declares uintptr and ptrdiff types that
     are guranteed to be the same size as a native pointer.
   - Added a PseudoFlattenable base class to Flatten.h, for subclasses
     that want to act like Flattenable objects but don't want to incur
     the memory overhead of actually having virtual methods.
   o Modified all MUSCLE code to use a SocketMultiplexer object
     rather than calling select() or poll() directly.
   o Added a testsocketmultiplexer.cpp test to the tests folder.
   * RefCount.h now uses uintptr instead of (unsigned long) when doing
     its pointer-bit-stuffing magic, to avoid pointer-truncation warnings
     from MSVC.
   * Message::FindFlat() now does the right thing when an object
     is added to the Message as a FlatCountableRef and then
     retrieved from the Message by value.

5.63 Released 12/1/2011
   - Added a MUSCLE_USE_POLL build option which, if defined,
     will cause ReflectServer::RunEventLoop() to base its
     event loop around poll() rather than select().  The benefit
     of this is that with poll() the FD_SETSIZE limit imposed
     by select() can be be avoided.
   - Made a number of previously protected methods in the
     AbstractReflectSession class public.
   - StorageReflectSession::PrintSessionsInfo() and
     StorageReflectSession::PrintFactoriesInfo() now print
     additional information about the state of the sessions/factories.
   - The Thread constructor now takes an optional boolean argument,
     so that you can now create a Thread that doesn't allocate a
     socket-pair for inter-thread messaging purposes.  This is useful
     when you want to create a lot of Threads but don't need to
     use socket-based inter-thread signalling and don't want to
     allocate a lot of sockets.
   - Added a FastClear() method to the Queue class (for when
     you care more about performance than about having item
     destructors get called right away).
   - Added a RemoveDuplicateItems() method to the Queue class.
   o Retired the MUSCLE_ENABLE_MULTICAST_API compiler flag, and added
     MUSCLE_AVOID_MULTICAST_API in its place.  (Which is another way
     of saying that the MUSCLE Multicast API calls are now enabled
     by default)

5.62 Released 11/2/2011
   - Added a CountedObject<T> class that various other MUSCLE classes
     now subclass from.  Subclassing from the CountedObject<T> class
     allows the application to efficiently keep track of the number
     of objects allocated of that type, for debugging/monitoring
     purposes.
   - Added a PrintCountedObjectInfo() function that prints to stdout
     a report of how many objects of each counted type are currently
     allocated.
   - Added a GetCountedObjectInfo() function that returns a Hashtable
     containing all of the current CountedObject counts.
   - Added support for a -DMUSCLE_AVOID_OBJECT_COUNTING compiler
     definition that will turn the object-counting code into a no-op
     if you want it disabled.
   - The Python Message.PrintToStream() method now recursively prints
     sub-Messages by default.  It has arguments that can be used to
     limit the depth of the recursion, if desired.
   - Added XINT64_FORMAT_SPEC macros to MuscleSupport.h.
   - MCRASH now calls __builtin_trap() under gcc/g++, rather than
     writing to an invalid pointer.
   - Added a GetGlobalObjectForType() function, which is similar
     to GetDefaultObjectForType() except that the returned reference
     is not read-only.
   o Merged in Jean-Fran√ßois Mullet's patches to allow MUSCLE to be
     compiled cleanly under Android.
   * Fixed the code so that it now compiles cleanly under clang++ 2.1.
   * String::AppendWord() no longer appends a separator string if
     the word to be appended is blank.
   * Added some missing string constant declarations to
     storage_reflect_constants.py
   * Fixed a bug an exception-string-formation line of message.py
   * Fixed a bug in StorageReflectSession::NodeChanged() that would
     cause incorrect PR_RESULT_UPDATE updates to be generated for
     subscribers using QueryFilter objects, if the matches-filter
     status of the node was changed by the node update.

5.61 Released 9/28/2011
   - Added a GetCurrentStackUsage() method to the Thread class.
   - Added a CheckThreadStackUsage() function and CHECK_THREAD_STACK_USAGE
     Macro to Thread.{cpp,h} to make it easier to determine if and
     when a Thread is allocating more stack space than it was allowed
     to allocate.
   - Added a ThreadPool class to the system folder.
   - Added EINTR-proof wrapper functions to NetworkUtilityFunctions.h
     for recv(), recvfrom(), send(), sendto(), read(), and write().
     MUSCLE code now calls the wrapper functions (e.g. recv_ignore_eintr)
     so that incoming signals won't cause spurious errors to be returned.
   - Added an Arg(const void *) method to the String class, so that
     Arg() can be used to print out pointer values.
   o Replaced String::AddWord() with String::AppendWord(), which is
     easier to use and takes an optional separator-string argument.
   * The Point and Rect implementations of String::Arg() were broken; fixed.

5.60 Released 9/19/2011
   - Added a qt_advanced_example directory to the qtsupport folder
     to demonstrate more advanced usage of the QMessageTransceiverThread
     class.  See the README.TXT and the diagram PNG in that directory
     for details.
   - Added a TamperEvidentValue<T> class (in support/TamperEvidentValue.h)
   - ThreadWorkerSession and ThreadWorkerSessionFactory objects now
     have (and use) a SendMessageToSupervisorSession() method for
     sending messages to their supervisor.  This is more efficient
     and less error-prone that calling BroadcastMessgeToAllSessions(),
     and relying on non-supervisor recipients to ignore the Messages
     that weren't meant for them, as was done previously.
   - Added SetForwardAllIncomingMessagesToSupervisor() and
     IsForwardAllIncomingMessagesToSupervisor() methods to the
     ThreadWorkerSession, ThreadWorkerSessionFactory, and
     MessageTransceiverThread classes.  These methods govern how
     Messages incoming from remote peers should be handled.
   o Retired the MUSCLE_USE_IPV6 compiler option, since enabled
     IPv6 support is now the default.  If you want to disable IPv6
     support, you'll need to specify -DMUSCLE_AVOID_IPV6 instead.
   o ThreadSupervisorSession::SendMessageToWorkers() is now
     protected rather than private.
   o MessageTransceiverThread::GetNextEventFromInternalThread
     now passes PR_RESULT_* Messages to the caller, so that it's
     possible to use a MessageTransceiverThread as if it it were
     a client to the local MUSCLE thread, if desired.
   o QMessageTransceiverThread now calls SetDoLogging(false)
     inside CreateReflectServer() rather than afterwards, so
     that subclasses can easily re-enable logging if they want to.
   * Gave the README.TXT file a badly needed rewrite/update.
   * Tweaked the doxygen.dox file to yield better-looking
     DOxygen HTML documentation.
   * genDocs.sh now automatically extracts the current
     MUSCLE version number from MuscleSupport.h, so it's
     no longer necessary to manually update the muscle.dox
     file for each MUSCLE release.

5.57 Released 9/16/2011
   - Added the following new compile-time constant
     definitions to NetworkUtilityFunctions.h:
       MUSCLE_EXPECTED_MTU_SIZE_BYTES
       MUSCLE_POTENTIAL_EXTRA_HEADERS_SIZE_BYTES
       MUSCLE_IP_HEADER_SIZE_BYTES
       MUSCLE_MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES_PER_UDP_ETHERNET_PACKET
     These constants (particularly the last one) are
     useful for deciding how many bytes of data can
     be added to a UDP packet without risking packet
     fragmentation.
   - testudp now prints out the values of the above
     constants when it is run.
   - Added a SetCount() method to the NestCount class.
   - HandleStandardDaemonArgs() now accepts "realtime_rr"
     or "realtime_fifo" as alternatives to the pre-existing
     "realtime" keyword, for those who like to specify
     their scheduling algorithm explicitly.
   * The PacketTunnelIOGateway constructor now uses
     MUSCLE_MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES_PER_UDP_ETHERNET_PACKET as
     its default maxTransferUnit value, rather than hard-coding
     a magic value of 1500 (which was too large anyway)
   * Fixed a bug that could cause Snooze64(MUSCLE_TIME_NEVER)
     to return immediately, rather than sleeping forever as
     intended.
   * GetHumanReadableTimeIntervalString(MUSCLE_TIME_NEVER)
     now returns "forever", rather than "584,942 years".
   * Fixed warning in DemandConstructedObject == operator.
   * Fixed warning in ZLibCodec destructor.

5.56 Released 9/4/2011
   - Added a StorageReflectSession::PrintFactoriesInfo()
     method to go with the existing PrintSessionsInfo() method.
   - Added InsertItemAtSortedPosition() methods to the Queue
     class, for convenience in doing insertion-sorting.
   - Added SetSuggestedStackSize() and GetSuggestedStackSize()
     methods to the Thread class.
   - Added a IsSymLink() method to the FilePathInfo class.
   - Added a qt_muscled folder to the qtsupport sub-directory.
     The .pro file in this folder builds a version of muscled that
     runs in a Qt GUI window.
   - Added a "Clone Window" button to the qt_example application,
     to make quick demonstrations of multiple-client scenarios
     easier.
   - The qt_example application is now more colorful -- each
     client gets assigned his own (random) color.
   o Added checks for (sizeof(float)==4) and (sizeof(double)==8)
     to the SanitySetupSystem constructor.
   o PrintHexBytes() and LogHexBytes() now take a
     ConstByteBufferRef rather than a ByteBufferRef, since
     they don't ever need to modify the ByteBuffer they receive.
   o DataNode objects now store their ordered-child index as
     a Queue of DataNodeRefs rather than a Queue of String pointers.
     This avoids any possibility of dangling pointers in the index.
   o DataNode::GetIndex() now returns a (Queue<DataNodeRef> *)
     rather than a (Queue<const String *> *).
   o DataNode::ReorderChild() now takes a DataNodeRef rather
     than a reference to a DataNode object.
   o Added util/FilePathInfo.cpp, and Moved the non-trivial
     FilePathInfo method bodies into it.
   o Made FileDescriptorDataIO.cpp compile (as a no-op)
     under Windows, to avoid project-file confusion.
   * CPULoadMeter::GetCPULoad() now uses uint64s to store tick
     counts rather than uint32s, to avoid potential overflows.
   * SysLog.cpp now works around the lack of a declaration
     for TzSpecifiedLocalTimeToSystemTime() function when compiling
     under Windows with the Mingw compiler.
   * Made several other tweaks for Mingw32 compatibility.
   * Fixed the qt_muscled.pro to work under Windows.
   * Fixed a bug in the qt_example application that would cause
     a qt_example client to disconnect and reconnect whenever
     the server-name field lost focus.

5.55 Released 7/28/2011
   - Added a "plain" keyword to hexterm's arguments; useful
     if you don't want any headers in hexterm's output
   - Made it possible to embed hexterm as part of a larger program.
   - Added Arg() methods to the String class that take a bool,
     a Point, or a Rect as an argument.
   - Added a ToMixedCase() method to the String class.
   - Added AddWord() methods to the String class.
   - Added HeadWithDefault() and TailWithDefault() methods to the
     Queue class that take a default-argument parameter.
   - Added a PrintSessionsInfo() method to the StorageReflectSession
     class, for quick discovery of what sessions are present and
     how much RAM they are each using.
   - The ObjectPool class now takes the maximum slab size as
     a template argument, and has an assertion-check to make
     sure that the resulting objects-per-slab count is small
     enough to be tracked by a uint16 (i.e. is less than 65536)
   * Fixed a crashing bug in hexterm's ASCII mode.

5.54 Released 6/24/2011
   - Added a GetDefaultObjectForType() templated function to
     MuscleSupport.h.  This function returns a reference to
     a default-constructed static object of the specified type.
   - Added a description of the Hashtable class's feature set
     to the Hashtable DOxygen documentation.
   - Added a const [] operator to the Hashtable class.  The
     [] operator behaves the same as the GetWithDefault() method.
   - Expanded and enhanced the DOxygen per-class documentation
     of various classes.
   o Reduced sizeof(Queue), sizeof(Hashtable), and
     sizeof(ObjectPool) by removing their default-object member
     items and adding calls to GetDefaultObjectForType() instead.
   o Replaced the various get-default-object convenience methods
     (GetEmptyString(), GetEmptyMessage(), etc) with inline
     call-throughs to GetDefaultObjectForType<Foo>().

5.53 Released 6/16/2011
   - Added TarFileWriter.{cpp,h} to the zlib folder.  This class
     allows for quick inline writing of .tar files to disk.
   - Added a MUSCLE_MAY_ALIAS macro to MuscleSupport.h, as
     an easier way to invoke gcc's __attribute__((__may_alias__)).
     This macro expands to empty under other compilers.
   - Added a version of the muscleCopyIn() function that returns
     the copied-in value, for convenience.
   - Added a DemandConstructedObject template (in
     util/DemandConstructedObject.h) to allow for member variables
     whose constructors aren't called until the object is actually
     needed for something.
   - Added a ClearAndFlush() method to the String class, for
     forcing a String object to free its allocated data.
   o Reduced sizeof(String), by by employing a union to reuse
     the bytes used for referencing small and large char arrays.
   o Reduced sizeof(Ref) by storing the boolean (doRefCount)
     value in the least significant bit of the item pointer.
     (this works because the item pointers are guaranteed
     to be word-aligned -- if for some reason that guarantee
     isn't valid for a given environment, the old method can
     be reinstated by adding -DMUSCLE_AVOID_REFCOUNT_BITSTUFFING
     to your compiler arguments)
   o Reduced sizeof(DataNode) by making the subscribers table
     demand-allocated, rather than a member variable.
   o Removed the MUSCLE_CPU_REQUIRES_DATA_ALIGNMENT define,
     because it is no longer used anywhere.
   * Rewrote the HashtableIterator class to no longer use
     type-punning trickery, so that g++ versions 4.4.0 and higher
     no longer complain about strict aliasing being broken.

5.52 Released 6/8/2011
   - Added a Tuple::Contains() convenience method.
   - Added a ExecuteSynchronousMessageSend() method to the
     MessageIOGateway class.  This method is similar to
     ExecuteSynchronousMessageRPCCall(), except that this method will
     return to the caller as soon as the Message is sent, without
     waiting for the server to return a reply Message.
   - Added CreateSynchronousPingMessage() and IsSynchronousPongMessage()
     hook methods to the MessageIOGateway class, so that subclasses can
     specify alternative ping/pong Messages if they wish to.
   - Added a IsCharInLocalArray() method to the String class.
   - Added a IsItemLocatedInThisContainer() method to the Queue class.
   - Added a GetNumUnusedItemSlots() method to the Queue class.
   - Added a + operator and += operators for the ByteBuffer class.
   - Made the + operators for the String class more efficient.
   o Converted the ExecuteSynchronousMessageRPCCall() functions into a method
     of the MessageIOGateway class, so that its behavior can be used in conjunction
     with a MessageIOGateway subclass to customize their behavior, if necessary.
   * Some of the methods in the Queue class could access freed memory
     if passed in references to held data items, and a reallocation occurred. Fixed.
   * Some of the methods in the String class could access freed memory
     if passed in references to their own string, and a reallocation occurred. Fixed.
   * Some of the methods in the ByteBuffer class could access freed memory
     if passed in a pointer to their own bytes, and a reallocation occurred. Fixed.
   * Fixed a bug in StorageReflectSession::NodePathMatcher::CheckChildForTraversal()
     that could cause the traversal callback to be called with an invalid DataNode,
     likely causing the callback to crash.  This bug was a regression introduced
     in the 5.51 release.
   * CalculateChecksumForFloat() and CalculateChecksumForDouble() would return
     different checksum values for 0.0 and -0.0, even though the == operator
     considers them equivalent.  Fixed.

5.51 Released 5/23/2011
   - Added convenience methods to the Queue class:  HeadWithDefault(),
     TailWithDefault(), RemoveHeadWithDefault(), RemoveTailWithDefault(),
     and RemoveItemAtWithDefault().  These methods are all safe to call
     even when the Queue is empty.
   - Added a SLIPFramedDataMessageIOGateway class to the iogateway
     folder.  As the name suggests, it is used to do SLIP encoding
     and decoding on outgoing and incoming raw data, respectively.
   - Added an AppendByte() method to the ByteBuffer class, for convenience.
   - The WARN_OUT_OF_MEMORY macro now prints the number of bytes that
     the failed memory allocation attempted to allocate.
   - Added SetExpendable() and IsExpendable() methods to the
     AbstractReflectSession class, to help influence which sessions
     will be thrown under the bus in a low-memory situation.
   o The QueryFilter::Matches() methods have been modified to take a
     (ConstMessageRef &) argument instead of (const Message &), so that
     it is now possible to create a QueryFilter subclass that modifies
     the data it returns.  (Not that any of the QueryFilter subclasses
     included in the MUSCLE distribution currently do this)
   o Removed the optional MemoryAllocator pointer argument from the
     ReflectServer constructor.  Now ReflectServer simply accesses the
     installed MemoryAllocator object directly (via
     GetCPlusPlusGlobalMemoryAllocator()) when necessary.
   * When MUSCLE_USE_IPV6 is defined, SharedFilterSessionFactory now
     compares ip_address objects using ip_address::EqualsIgnoreInterfaceIndex()
     instead of the == operator.  This avoids spurious mismatches between IPv4
     addresses that have their interface index set, and those that don't.
   * UnparseArgs(const Message &) wasn't escaping quote marks embedded
     in the strings in the Message.  Fixed.
   * UnparseArgs(const Message &) wasn't properly handling multiple values
     filed under the same field name.  Fixed.

5.50 Released 4/18/2011
   - Added a qt_muscled_browser subfolder to the qtsupport folder.  qt_muscled_browser
     is a GUI MUSCLE database browser, based on code contributed by Jean-Fran√ßois Mullet.
   - Added GetFirstKeyWithDefault(), GetLastKeyWithDefault(), GetFirstValueWithDefault(),
     and GetLastValueWithDefault() convenience methods to the Hashtable class.
   - Added a RemoveWithDefault() convenience method to the Hashtable class.
   - Added a CountAverageLookupComparisons() method to the Hashtable class,
     to help determine the hashing performance of various hash functions.
   - Added a -DMUSCLE_WARN_ABOUT_LOUSY_HASH_FUNCTIONS preprocessor define,
     which will cause the Hashtable reallocator to calculate the hashtable's
     average lookup comparisons value after every hashtable resize, and
     complain if the average lookup count is too high.
   - Added 3-argument constructors to the AndOrQueryFilter and NandNotQueryFilter classes.
   - Added regex/FilePathExpander.{cpp,h}.  These files contain a single function,
     ExpandFilePathWildCards(), which expands wildcarded file paths into a list of
     non-wildcarded paths, similar to shell expansion.
   - Added test/testmatchfiles.cpp, a unit test for the ExpandFilePathWildCards() function.
   o Moved the boolean "isAnd" argument to the front of the arguments list for the
     AndOrQueryFilter constructors.
   o Removed the -DMUSCLE_COLLECT_HASHTABLE_COLLISION_STATISTICS preprocessor
     define, since the new -DMUSCLE_WARN_ABOUT_LOUSY_HASH_FUNCTIONS replaces it.
   o PortableReflectClient now includes a string showing the current time when you
     's'et a node, so it's easier to see the node change in other clients.
   * FilePathInfo::SetFilePath(NULL) would crash.  Fixed.
   * ChildProcessDataIO::System() and ChildProcessDataIO::LaunchChildProcess()
     weren't NULL-terminating their argv arrays.  Fixed.

5.43 Released 3/29/2011
   - Added GetSocketBlockingEnabled() function to NetworkUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}
   - Added GetSocketNaglesAlgorithmEnabled() function to NetworkUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}
   - Added GetSocketSendBufferSize() function to NetworkUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}
   - Added GetSocketReceiveBufferSize() function to NetworkUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}
   - Added GetUDPSocketBroadcastEnabled() function to NetworkUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}
   - hexterm now batches its stdin input together to send in fewer buffers, if possible.
   - Added a libmuscle.a target to the Makefile in the server folder.
   - Directory::MakeDirectory() now takes an optional third argument to specify
     whether the pre-existence of the requested directory should be considered an error.
   - Added a qt_example sub-directory to the qtsupport folder.  This directory
     contains buildable code for a sample Qt-based GUI MUSCLE client.
   * FilePathInfo now handles file paths ending in a slash properly, even if the
     filesystem object located at that path is not a directory.
   * Fixed hexterm so that it no longer exits prematurely when reading stdin from a file.
   * ChildProcessDataIO::System(const Queue<String> &) wasn't declared static.  Fixed.

5.42 Released 2/26/2011
   - Added SetEnabled() and IsEnabled() methods to the
     DetectNetworkConfigChangesSession class.
   o Removed the ability to set String objects using an argument of type
     'char', because having it was preventing the compiler from catching
     errors where an integer is assigned to a String.  Use s = String(&c, 1)
     instead.
   * The SharedMemory wasn't interpreting the return value of shmat()
     calls correctly.  Fixed.
   * Fixed the access privileges of the Hashtable classes so that they now
     compile under g++ 4.4.x.

5.41 Released 2/2/2011
   - Added a ParseBool() function to MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}
   - Added convenience implementations of PrintHexBytes() and LogHexBytes()
     that accept ByteBuffers and ByteBufferRefs.
   - PrintHexBytes() and LogHexBytes() can now gracefully accept NULL
     pointers without crashing (they will just print out "NULL buffer"
     instead of any hex bytes)
   - printsourcelocations now filters out commented-out calls to LogTime().
   - Hashtable.h now declares a Void class that can be used as a
     placeholder for Hashtables that need only keys, not values.
   - Added a PutWithDefault() method to the Hashtable class.
   - Added a CanRegexStringMatchMultipleValues() function to StringMatcher.cpp.
   - Added CaseInsensitiveNumericAwareStringCompareFunctor and
     NumericAwareStringCompareFunctor classes to String.h
   - printsourcelocations now sorts its output by key before emitting it.
   o Added \r and \n to the list of characters that StringTokenizer
     will treat as word-separators by default.
   * PrintHexBytes() and LogHexBytes() were incorrectly writing some
     of their decorative output to stdout, instead of to the specified
     FILE stream.  Fixed.
   * Added some #ifdefs to hexterm.cpp and some logic to the tests Makefile
     so that when hexterm is built as part of a Meyer software release,
     it will show the standard Meyer software version string.
   * ReflectServer::DisconnectSession() now calls ShutdownIOFor() on the
     disconnected session, even if the session is to become a lame duck.
     That way TCP connections are guaranteed to be disconnected quickly.
   * PulseNode::GetCycleStartTime() now returns the correct value even
     for PulseNodes that are children of other PulseNodes.
   * Hashtable now uses == operator on user-values, not the != operator.
   * The Hashtable class's Get(key), GetFirstValue(), and GetLastValue()
     methods were not properly enforcing const-correctness.  Fixed.

5.40 Released 12/20/2010
   - Added various time-units-conversion functions to TimeUtilityFunctions.h
   - Added a few time-related constants to TimeUtilityFunctions.h
   - Added a DetectNetworkConfigChangesSession class, which can be used
     to install a handler that is called whenever the host computer's
     networking configuration has changed.
   - Added testnetconfigdetect.cpp to the tests folder, as a simple
     test/example of using the DetectNetworkConfigChangesSession class.
   - Added a TelnetPlainTextMessageIOGateway class, that works similarly
     to PlainTextMessageIOGateway, except that it filters out any
     telnet-protocol control codes that get sent from the client.
   o Made it a no-op to call AbstractReflectSession::EndSession()
     on a session that isn't attached to a server.  (Previously it
     would trigger an assertion failure, but an unattached session
     is already effectively ended so there's no point in crying over it)
   o Code cleanup:  Magic-number time-unit conversions in several places
     now use the new time-conversion functions instead, for clarity.
   o Simplified the SharedUsageLimitProxyMemoryAllocator.  It no longer
     maintains a running sum of the total memory usage of the daemon
     set, but rather recalculates the current sum when needed.
   * The StringMatcher class's copy constructor wasn't initializing
     its _bits field to zero, which could cause undefined behavior.  Fixed.
   * StringMatcher::SetPattern() didn't clear the negate-bit when
     setting a non-simple (aka full regex) pattern.  Fixed.

5.35 Released 12/5/2010
   - Added a MoveToPosition(key, idx) method to the Hashtable class.
   - Added a InsertOrderedChildNode() utility method to the
     StorageReflectSession class.
   - hexterm now includes a version number in its LogUsage() text.
   - ChildProcessDataIO::Launch*() can now be told to only capture
     output to stderr, or stdout
   - Added a GetTotalDataSize() method to the ObjectPool class.
   - Added a GetNumAllocatedItemSlots() method to the ObjectPool class.
   o Changed QueryFilterRef arguments to ConstQueryFilterRef where appropriate.
   o Replaced the (usePty) boolean in ChildProcessDataIO::Launch*()
     method with a launchBits bit-chord, so that multiple options
     can be specified.
   o Renamed Hashtable::GetNumAllocatedSlots() to GetNumAllocatedItemSlots().
   * GetSystemMemoryUsagePercentage() was not being calculated
     accurately under MacOS/X.  Fixed.
   * ZLibUtilityFunctions.cpp now installs a cleanup-callback when
     necessary, so that any privately allocated ZLibCodec objects
     will be deleted as part of the shutdown sequence and thus won't
     show up in valgrind as possibly-leaked-memory anymore.
   * ByteBuffer::SetBuffer() now deallocates the current buffer if
     the new data size is less than half of the current data size,
     to avoid wasting memory.

5.34 Released 10/19/2010
   - Added an optional (maxAsyncConnectPeriod) argument to the
     AddNewConnectSession() and AddNewDormantConnectSession()
     methods of the AbstractReflectSession and MessageTransceiverThread
     classes.
   - Added SetMaxAsyncConnectPeriod() and GetMaxAsyncConnectPeriod()
     methods to the AbstractReflectSession class.
   - Added an optional MUSCLE_MAX_ASYNC_CONNECT_DELAY_MICROSECONDS
     constant to the set of compiler -D flags that the muscle code
     looks for during compilation.
   - Added Strcasecmp() and Strncasecmp() wrapper functions to
     MiscUtilities.h, to hide Windows' inconsistent function names.
   - muscled and the programs in the tests folder are now compiled
     with the -DMUSCLE_USE_IPV6 flag enabled.
   - Added support for "disablestdout" and "disablestderr" startup
     arguments, that cause the program to close its STDOUT_FILENO
     and STDERR_FILENO file descriptors, respectively (and thus
     suppress its output from then on)
   - DebugTimer can now accept a negative logLevel parameter, which
     will force it to output using printf() instead of LogTime().
   - Added a GetSystemMemoryUsagePercentage() function to
     MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}

5.33 Released 8/31/2010
   - Added an optional (argIdx) argument to ParseConnectArg()
     and ParsePortArg() in MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}
   - Added a udpproxy program to the tests folder.  This can
     be used to forward UDP packets to and from a further
     destination.
   - Added a NumericAwareStrcasecmp() function to String.{cpp,h}.
   - Added NumericAwareCompareTo() and NumericAwareCompareToIgnoreCase()
     methods to the String class.
   - Added SetMask() and GetMask() methods to the NumericQueryFilter
     class, to allow bitfield masking all numeric QueryFilters.
   - Added a printtypecode program to the test folder, for quickly
     getting the ASCII representation of a 32-bit type code.
   o Changed String::CompareToIgnoreCase() to call strcasecmp()
     rather than calling ToUpper() on both strings.
   o Removed the OP_CONTAINS_BITS and OP_DOESNT_CONTAIN_BITS operators
     from the NumericQueryFilter class, as that functionality can
     now be handled more generally via the SetMask() call instead.
   * Inet_PtoN now sets the ai_flags value to AI_NUMERICHOST under
     Windows, so that non-numeric address strings (e.g. "") are no
     longer possibly misinterpreted as valid IP address strings.
   * ParseArgs() now un-escapes any escaped quote marks.
   * The micromuscle Java classes were still packaged under
     com.lcs.*.  Changed them to com.meyer.*

5.32 Released 7/22/2010
   - Added a GetTimeStampForHumanReadableTimeValues() function
     to SysLog.{cpp,h}.  This function does the inverse operation
     of GetHumanReadableTimeValues().
   - Added a HumanReadableTimeValues::ToString() method,
     for convenience.
   - Added SetFSyncOnClose() and IsFSyncOnClose() methods to the
     FileDescriptorDataIO class.
   - Added a SortFieldNames() method to the Message class.
   - Added FindMatchingNode() and FindMatchingNodes() convenience
     methods to the StorageReflectSession class.
   - Added a serialproxy utility to the tests folder.  This program
     exports a local serial port as a TCP port.
   - Message::FieldsAreSubsetOf() is now a public method.
   o Replaced GetServerUptime() with GetServerStartTime(), so
     that the returned value can remain meaningful even if stored
     for a period of time.
   * Threads in a Java com.meyer.muscle.thread.ThreadPool object
     now exit cleanly when they are interrupted (e.g. by an
     applet shutdown).  Previously they would just ignore the
     InterruptedException and stick around, gumming things up.
   * The interface-0-send-detect code no longer prints an error
     if the destination address is (invalidIP), on the assumption
     that the UDP socket was previously connected using
     SetUDPSocketTarget() in that case.
   * ReceiveDataUDP() now returns correct source-address/port
     information even when receiving IPv4 UDP packets while
     compiled with the MUSCLE_USE_IPV6 flag defined.

5.31 Released 6/7/2010
   - Added LaunchIndepentChildProcess() static methods to the
     ChildProcessDataIO class, for quick fire-and-forget style
     launching of child processes.
   - Added an optional maxWaitTimeMicros argument to the
     ChildProcessDataIO::System() methods.
   - Added a QDataIODevice adaptor class to the qtsupport folder.
   - Made the MUSCLE GetCurrentThreadID() function publicly
     available (declared in system/SetupSystem.h).
   - Added a MUSCLE_ENABLE_DEADLOCK_FINDER flag.
   - The deadlock-finder no longer requires manual insertion
     of PLOCK and PUNLOCK macros everywhere; instead, that
     functionality is conditionally compiled into the
     Mutex class itself.
   - Added code to deadlockfinder.cpp to detect inconsistent
     sequences and print error messages about them, instead of
     just printing out all sequences and leaving it up to the
     user to detect any problems.
   o The deadlock-finder generation code now stores up its output
     in RAM until the process is exiting, and dumps it to stdout
     at that time.  That way race conditions in accessing stdout
     are avoided, so the output won't be garbled.
   o LockLog() and UnlockLog() now lock/unlock a separate lock
     that is dedicated to the log callbacks only, instead of
     calling through to the global muscle lock.
   o InflateBuffer() and DeflateBuffer() now use their own
     Mutex also, for reasons similar to those listed above.
   * The Windows implementation of ChildProcessDataIO now marks
     its master/slave notify sockets as non-inheritable, so that
     subsequent child process won't hold them open unexpectedly.

5.30 Released 5/7/2010
   - Added proper copy/assignment/equality operators to the
     StringMatcher class, and added a HashCode() method to
     it so that it can be a key in a Hashtable.
   - Added OP_CONTAINS_BITS and OP_DOESNT_CONTAIN_BITS operators
     to the NumericDataQueryFilter family of classes, so that
     you can do some bit-chord logic in a QueryFilter.
   - Added an Area() method to the Rect class.
   - Added optional checksum calculation and printing to hexterm.
   - Added a GetDefaultObject() method to the ObjectPool class
     that gives read-only access to the ObjectPool's persistent
     default-constructed object.
   - Added a GetEmptyByteBuffer() function to ByteBuffer.{cpp,h}
   o GetEmptyMessageRef() now returns a ConstMessageRef instead
     of a MessageRef, to ensure that the returned Message is
     not (easily) modified.
   o GetEmptyByteBufferRef() now returns a ConstByteBufferRef
     instead of a MessageRef, to ensure that the returned
     ByteBuffer is not (easily) modified.
   o Simplified the ObjectPool class to make it less error-prone
     and easier to use.  The function callbacks are gone; instead,
     recycled objects are reset to their default state simply by
     using their assignment operator to set them equal to a
     default-constructed object.
   o IsRegexToken() no longer considers ':' to be a regex token.
     This change is because ':' is often used in otherwise non-regex
     strings, and is never the only regex character in a regex string.
   * Fixed some compiler warnings under MSVC 2008
   * Fixed a bug that would cause subscriptions not to be properly
     unsubscribed in some cases.

5.23 Released 4/22/2010
   - The Parse*() functions in MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h} now take
     an optional (caseSensitive) boolean argument.  If left false
     (the default), parsing will be case sensitive, as it was in
     previous versions.  If set to true, then arguments will be left
     in their original case and not forced to lower case.
   - Added information to the leaked-ObjectPool-Ref assertion failure
     error message, so that now the type and the address of the leaked
     reference(s) are printed out as part of the assertion failure.
   - Rewrote the ObjectNode class to use uint16 indices instead of
     pointers, to reduce memory usage (especially on 64-bit systems)
   - Added a Clear() convenience method to the Socket class.
   - Added Append() and Prepend() methods to the String class that
     take a char as an argument.
   o Changed the (recurse) argument in Message::PrintToStream(),
     Message::ToString(), and Message::AddToString() to a
     (maxRecurseLevel) uint32 argument instead, so that user-specified
     maximum recursion depths can be supported.
   o Re-organized the GlobalSocketCallbacks so that they all happen
     immediately after the socket is created.
   o Changed the "Couldn't disable V6-only mode" message to MUSCLE_LOG_DEBUG.
   o Made the Message(uint32) constructor explicit.
   * Tweaked the code so that hexterm once again compiles under Windows.
   * Tweaked NetworkUtilityFunction.cpp to build again even when
     MUSCLE_ENABLE_MULTICAST_API is not defined.
   * MUSCLE sockets now have IPV6_V6ONLY explicitly disabled when they
     are created, so that IPv4-mapped sockets will work even under
     operating systems that disable them by default (read: Windows 7)
   * The MCRASH macro no longer calls FatalAppExit() under windows;
     instead it just writes to a NULL pointer.  That way if there is
     a crash handler installer, it will run.

5.22 Released 3/3/2010
   - Added SetSocketKeepAliveBehavior() and GetSocketKeepAliveBehavior()
     functions to NetworkUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.  Note that these functions
     are only available if MUSCLE_ENABLE_KEEPALIVE_API is defined.
   - Added SetGlobalSocketCallback() and GetGlobalSocketCallback() to
     NetworkUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}, to allow all TCP sockets in the
     process to be set up in a similar way, if desired.
   - Added a portablereflectclient.vcproj file to the tests folder, so that
     portablereflectclient can be compiled under Microsoft Visual Studio.
   - The AtomicCounter class now uses the OSAtomicCounter.h atomic counter
     API when compiled under MacOS/X.
   - Added an optional (maxReplaceCount) arg to the String::Replace() methods.
   - Added a ServerComponent::IsFullyAttachedToServer() method, which returns
     true iff AttachedToServer() has already returned success, and
     AboutToDetachFromServer() hasn't been called yet.
   o Removed MUSCLE_CUSTOM_ATOMIC_TYPE support from the AtomicCounter class,
     since it wasn't useful and was cluttering up the code.
   o Rewrote the CalculateChecksum() and CalculateChecksumFor*() methods
     to call through to CalculateHashCode(), since the existing checksum
     algorithms were not very good at avoiding checksum collisions.
   * Updated win32client.vcproj and win32client.cpp to build properly again.
   * Fixed a couple of typos in AsyncDataIO.cpp.
   * GetFileLogName() is no longer included in the MUSCLE_INLINE_LOGGING
     headers in SysLog.h, since its inclusion caused chicken-and-egg problems.
   * Added inline versions of PrintStackTrace(), GetStackTrace(),
     GetLogLevelName(), and GetLogLevelKeyword().
   * Made all of the inline log functions into static inlines.

5.21 Released 1/21/2010
   - Added UnparseFile() functions to MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.
     These convert a ParseFile()-style Message back into a text file.
   - Added printsourcelocations.cpp to the tests folder.  This program
     will scan a source code directory tree and print out the 4-letter
     source location codes corresponding to all calls to LogTime(),
     along with their human-readable location and the line of source code.
   * The source code location alphabet had the numeral '5' in it, which
     was not supposed to be there (it looks too much like 'S').  Removed it.
   * Fixed a bug where UnparseArg("arg= val") wouldn't parse correctly.
   * Fixed a potential race condition in ObjectPool::Drain().
   * Some dependencies were missing from the VC++ project files; added them.
   * Converted RefCount::CheckedGetItemPointer() from a method into
     a stand-alone inline function, because calling methods on a NULL
     pointer is specified as causing undefined behavior in C++, and
     therefore having CheckedGetItemPointer() as a method is unsafe.
   * Removed unnecessary files from the vc++ folder, updated vc++/README.txt

5.20 Released 12/29/2009
   - PrintStackTrace() is now implemented under MSVC/Win32, using
     Jochen Kalmbach's StackWalker class.
   - The debugcrashes command line argument is now supported under
     MSVC/Win32; with it specified, crashes will cause PrintStackTrace()
     to be called, and therefore a stack trace to be printed to stdout.
   - Added a GetTotalDataSize() method to the Hashtable and Queue classes,
     so that it's possible to query how much RAM the container is using.
   - The Message::*Flat() methods are now templated so that the object
     you pass in to them doesn't have to be a subclass of Flattenable...
     it just have to have necessary methods declared.  This lets you
     save memory on small flattenable objects since they no longer
     need a vtable pointer.
   - Added a GetFlattenedByteBufferFromPool() method to ByteBuffer.h.
   - The HashtableEntry class now stores references to other
     HashtableEntries as uint32 slot indices rather than pointers, so
     that its memory footprint doesn't increase on 64-bit systems.
   - Added a GetRawArrayPointer() method to the Queue class to
     allow direct/low-level access to the Queue's items array.
   - UnparseArgs(const Queue &) now takes optional startIdx and
     afterEndIdx arguments.
   o Rewrote/simplified the HashtableIterator class:  Removed all of
     the HasMore*(), GetNext*(), and PeekNext*() methods.  The only
     methods remaining are GetKey(), GetValue(), HasData(),
     operator++(), and operator--().
   o Rewrote/simplified the MessageFieldNameIterator class:  Removed
     the HasMoreFieldNames(), GetNextFieldName() and PeekNextFieldName()
     methods.  The only methods remaining are HasData(), GetFieldName(),
     operator++, and operator--.
   o The String, Point and Rect classes no longer derive from
     Flattenable, and no longer have any virtual methods.
   o Removed the (initialSize) constructor argument from the Queue
     and PathMatcherQueue classes, since it was rarely used and added
     4 bytes to the size of the Queue class.
   * debugcrashes is also now enabled under OS/X.
   * Rewrote the POSIX implementation of ChildProcessDataIO so that
     the marshalling of the child process's arguments array is done
     in the parent process rather than between fork() and execve();
     that avoids potential problems with doing dynamic memory allocation
     during that awkward phase of the child's development.
   * Added a work-around in SendDataUDP() for a misfeature of MacOS/X
     (and possibly other IP stacks) where sendto() will send on the
     default interface even when the destination address clearly
     specifies another interface.
   * Replaced calls to gmtime() with gmtime_r(), for thread safety.

5.11 Released 11/23/2009
   - Added GetHumanReadableTimeIntervalString() to SysLog.h.
   - Added GetEmptyByteBufferRef() to ByteBuffer.{cpp,h}.
   - Added a DataNode::GetChild() method that returns the result as
     a return value rather than as a by-reference parameter.
   - ParseHumanReadableTimeIntervalString() can now correctly parse
     multiple-clause time interval strings of the type generated by
     GetHumanReadableTimeIntervalString().
   - Added a GetPulseParent() method to the PulseNode class.
   * Removed the MUSCLE_ROUTING_FLAG_REFLECT_TO_SELF bit from the
     DEFAULT_MUSCLE_ROUTING_FLAGS_BIT_CHORD constant, since including
     this bit made the sessions' default routing behavior different
     from what it was (and is) documented to be.
   * BatchOperator now calls BatchEnds() from within the batch context
     instead of after the batch context has ended, for consistency
     with the semantics of BatchBegins().
   o Rewrote the Windows implementation of the Mutex class to use
     critical sections rather than locking a Windows Mutex directly,
     for better performance.
   o Renamed the Python files in the python folder from e.g. CamelCase.py
     to e.g. lower_underbar_case.py, per the Python Style Guide.
   o Made CalculateHashCode() and CalculateHashCode64() non-inline
     functions, since they are rather large to be inlined.
   * Rewrote the Xenomai implementation of GetRunTime64() to call
     rt_timer_tsc() instead of rt_timer_read(), so that the value
     returned is nanoseconds-since-boot, not nanoseconds-since-1970.
   * The "realtime" command line argument support now memsets() the
     sched_param struct to zero before filling it out, just in case
     it has other members besides sched_priority.
   * Fixed a bug in the Hashtable class where copying one Hashtable
     to another could cause multiple identical entries to appear
     in the target table's iteration list.

5.10 Released 10/12/2009
   - Added a HashCode() method to the Tuple, Point, and Rect classes,
     so that they can now be used as keys in a Hashtable.
   - Added a Hashtable::Intersect() convenience method.
   - Added SetRoutingFlag() and IsRoutingFlagSet() methods to the
     DumbReflectSession class.  These flags allow subclasses of
     DumbReflectSession to change default/unrecognized routing
     behavior to be more appropriate for their needs, if necessary.
   - Added two new parameters that can be set via
     PR_COMMAND_SETPARAMETERS and got via PR_COMMAND_GETPARAMETERS.
     They are PR_NAME_ROUTE_GATEWAY_TO_NEIGHBORS and
     PR_NAME_ROUTE_NEIGHBORS_TO_GATEWAY and they control the
     similarly named bits in the DumbReflectSession class.
   - Added a (reconnectViaTCP) argument to the AbstractReflectSession::
     SetAsyncConnectDestination() method, so you can specify whether
     Reconnect() should connect to the supplied address via a standard
     TCP connection, or not.
   - The file log name (as set by the "logfile" command line argument
     or SetFileLogName()) is now interpreted by
     HumanReadableTimeValues::ExpandTokens(), so it can use any of
     the standard tokens and they will be expanded to their values
     at the time the log file is created.
   - File logging now supports maximum log file sizes (via the
     "maxlogfilesize=n" keyword and via the new SetMaxLogFileSize()
     and GetMaxLogFileSize() functions).  When a log file becomes
     larger than the specified size, it will be closed and a new
     log file opened.
   - Log files closed because they are too large can be optionally
     gzip-compressed (if the "compresslogfiles" keyword is specified,
     or via the new SetFileLogCompressionEnabled() function)
   - Added an optional "maxnumlogfiles" argument (and associated
     SetMaxNumLogFiles() and GetMaxNumLogFiles() functions) that
     allow you to specify that old log files should start to be
     deleted after a certain number of log files have been created.
   - Added an optional "oldlogfilespattern" argument  (and associated
     SetOldLogFilesPattern() function) that lets you specify the
     pattern of file-paths that can be safely assumed to be old log
     files from previous instances of the current application, and
     deleted if necessary.
   - Added a SetFile() method to the FileDataIO class.
   - Added AppendBytes() methods to the ByteBuffer class.
   - Added InflateByteBuffer() and DeflateByteBuffer() functions
     to ZLibUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.
   - Added raw-pointer versions of the Inflate(), Deflate(), and
     GetInflatedSize() methods of the ZLibCodec class.
   - Set EXTRACT_ALL to yes in the muscle.dox file, so that the
     non-member functions will show up in the DOyxgen documentation.
   - Added Doxygen groups around the non-class APIs, so that they
     show up as Modules in the Doxygen HTML.
   - Added a brief Doxygen \mainpage introduction blurb.
   o Changed the MUSCLE_VERSION macro in support/MuscleSupport.h
     from hexadecimal to decimal, so it can be more readable.
   o FileDataIO ctor's argument now defaults to NULL.
   o Log() and LogTime() no longer inhibit re-entrant calls during
     log callbacks.  This allows the callbacks to do logging themselves,
     although they do need to be careful to avoid infinite recursions.
   o GetNumAvailableBytes(), GetMaxNumBytes(), and GetNumUsedBytes()
     now return uint64's instead of uint32's, so that they can
     deal with more than 4 gigabytes of RAM allocation.
   o DumbReflectSession::SetReflectToSelf() and GetReflectToSelf()
     are now deprecated inline synonyms for
     SetRoutingFlag(MUSCLE_ROUTING_FLAG_REFLECT_TO_SELF) and
     GetRoutingFlag(MUSCLE_ROUTING_FLAG_REFLECT_TO_SELF), respectively.
   o ParseArgs() no longer strips leading dashes off of the arguments
     it parses, because doing that made it impossible to pass negative
     numbers as command line arguments.
   o Added a PrintStackTrace() comment to SysLog.cpp for easy
     copy-and-paste to third party code when necessary.
   o Moved the HumanReadableTimeValues class and its related
     functions out of MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h} and into
     SysLog.{cpp,h}, so that programs that use the system log
     but not the other functions in MiscUtilityFunctions.cpp do
     not need to link in MiscUtilityFunctions.cpp.
   o Moved Atoll() and Atoull() from MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}
     to SetupSystem.cpp and MuscleSupport.h, for the same reasons.
   * Fixed some printf() formatting warnings that occurred when the
     C code (MiniMessage, etc) was compiled on a 64-bit OS.
   * Changed a constant in SharedUsageLimitProxyMemoryAllocator
     from MUSCLE_NO_LIMIT to ((size_t)-1) so that it would work
     properly under 64-bit OS's.
   * NetworkInterfaceInfo::ToString() was broken.  Fixed.

5.00 Released 9/16/2009
   - Added a MUSCLE_VERSION define that is the numeric counterpart
     to the MUSCLE_VERSION_STRING define.  This makes it easier to
     write code that will build against multiple MUSCLE versions, if
     necessary.
   - Split DataIO::GetSelectSocket() into two methods, GetReadSelectSocket()
     and GetWriteSelectSocket().  This way a DataIO can use two different
     file handles for event-catching if it wants to.
   - Split AbstractReflectSession::GetSessionSelectSocket() into
     GetSessionReadSelectSocket() and GetSessionWriteSelectSocket().
   - Reimplemented the ARRAYITEMS macro in C++ land to be a templated
     function instead.  This has the advantage of making it a compile-time
     error if you try to call ARRAYITEMS() with a pointer argument.
   - muscleCompare() now depends only on the less-than operator.
     Before it depended on less-than and greater-than working as expected.
   - Removed the DECLARE_HASHTABLE_KEY_CLASS* macros, since they are no
     longer needed.  Appropriate HashFunctors are now selected automatically
     through SFINAE magic; all the user has to do is add a
     "uint32 HashCode() const" method into his key class and it will be used.
   - HashFunctor classes now also have a AreKeysEqual() method for determining
     whether two keys are equivalent or not in a type-appropriate manner.
   - Added support for a MUSCLE_COLLECT_HASHTABLE_COLLISION_STATISTICS #ifdef
     which can be used to test the efficacy of different hash functions.
   - Added CalculateHashCode() and CalculateHashCode64() functions to
     MuscleSupport.h.  These functions return hash codes for any array of
     bytes using Austin Appleby's MurmurHash2_Aligned algorithms.
   - The Hashtable class no longer chooses its array sizes based on prime
     numbers; instead it now relies on a better hash function (MurmurHash2.0)
     that will hash values well no matter what the array size is.
   - Optimized the String class's reallocation strategy to conserve memory
     better when dealing with very long strings.
   - Added a GetNumAllocatedBytes() method to the String class.
   - Added IsValid() and IsNull() convenience methods to the ConstRef class.
   - Added a version of DataNode::GetNodePath() that returns a String.
   - Added ToCaseInsensitive(const String &) to regex/StringMatcher.h
   - Added a PutOrRemove() method to the Hashtable class that takes
     a pointer to the value (NULL pointer means remove).
   - Added a GetAncestorNode() convenience method to the DataNode class.
   - Added ++ and -- operators to the String class.  (they add a space
     and remove the last character in the string, respectively)
   - ParseHumanReadableTimeIntervalString() now recognized special strings
     "forever", "never", and "infinite" and will return MUSCLE_TIME_NEVER in
     response to any of those keywords.
   - ParseFile() can now accept its file data in the form of a String
     as well as a (FILE *).
   - Added BroadcastToAllSessionsOfType<SessionType>() templated methods
     to the AbstractReflectSession and ReflectSessionFactory classes.
   - Added GetWithDefault() methods to the Queue class.
   - Added a GetDataIO() convenience method to the AbstractReflectSession class.
   - Added a GNII_INCLUDE_NONLOOPBACK_INTERFACES,
     GNII_INCLUDE_ENABLED_INTERFACES, and GNII_INCLUDE_DISABLED_INTERFACES
     flags GetNetworkInterfaceInfos() function's flag argument options.
   - Merged in Monni's patch to make the B_SWAP_*() macros call through to
     MSVC's _byteswap_*() functions on versions of MSVC that support that.
   - Added a Contains(const ItemType &) convenience method to the Queue class.
   - AbstractMessageIOGateway now derives from AbstractGatewayMessageReceiver,
     so that you can link the input of one gateway directly to the output
     of another if you want to.
   - Added a SetFilterForEntry() method to the PathMatcher class so that
     existing PathMatcherEntry objects can have their filters updated without
     throwing the PathMatcher class's filter-count out of whack.
   - Added ToString() methods to the PathMatcherEntry and StringMatcherQueue
     classes, to better facilitate debugging.
   o Removed CStringHashFunc() and CStringHashFunc64() functions; any code
     that was previously using those should call CalculateHashCode(s,strlen(s))
     instead.
   o Split the Hashtable class auto-sort functionality out into subclasses.
     The Hashtable class no longer supports auto-sort; instead you now
     instantiate an OrderedKeysHashtable or an OrderedValuesHashtable
     if you want a table that keeps its data sorted.
   o All Hashtable sorting is now done via CompareFunctors instead of
     via function pointers.
   o Rewrote the Queue::Sort() method to used a templatized CompareFunctor
     object instead of a function pointer.  This allows the compiler to
     inline the comparisons for better performance, and also frees the
     programmer from having to manually specify a comparison function in
     most cases.
   o Remove the Compare*() callback functions from MuscleSupport.h because
     they are no longer needed (use functors instead)
   o Made PulseNode::InvalidatePulseTime() public instead of protected.
   o Made the object-capturing constructors in the RefCount and ConstRefCount
     classes explicit, so that object-capture can't happen without the
     programmer's explicit knowledge.
   o ExecuteSynchronousMessageRPCCall() now returned an empty Message
     if it connects successfully but receives no reply.  That way the
     caller can differentiate that case from the could-not-connect case.
   o Removed UNLESS() macro, since it was never used and was bad style.
   o FindFirstSessionOfType() and FindSessionsOfType() template methods
     now take <SessionType> as their template argument, not <SessionPointerType>
   o Removed some characters from the source-location-code alphabet to
     reduce the risk of inadvertent swearing in the lock file.
   * Rewrote the Windows implemetation of StdinDataIO (again) so that closing
     a StdinDataIO object no longer tries to shut down the Stdin I/O thread.
     That appears impossible to do reliably under the awesome Windows API,
     so now the Stdin I/O thread is a singleton that always runs (safely
     minding its own business) until stdin closes.
   * Fixed a typo in MessageTransceiverThread.py
   * ExecuteSynchronousMessageRPCCall() now includes the TCP-connect time
     in its calculations regarding the timeout period.
   * ParseHumanReadableTimeInterval() now defaults to seconds when
     no units are specified (previously it would return zero in that case).
   * String::operator-(const char) had a bug where it would read one
     byte too many as part of its memmove() call.  Fixed.
   * Atoll() and Atoull() weren't handling invalid strings
     (with preceding non-digit characters) properly.  Fixed.
   * Added a _M_AMD64 case ot the LITTLE_ENDIAN byte ordering detection,
     per Mika Lindqvist's suggestion.
   * GetNetworkInterfaceInfos() no longer returns results for interfaces
     that are not currently up/enabled.
   * SharedFilterSessionFactory::CreateSession() now assumes that any
     connection coming in over the Loopback device is a local connection,
     even if the source IP address isn't recognized as a local address
     (a situation that can happen on a Mac when an interface has been
     disabled)
   * Fixed a bug in AbstractMessageIOGateway::ExecuteSynchronousMessaging()
     that would cause it to sometimes return B_ERROR even when it had, in
     fact, successfully completed.
   * In MUSCLE_USE_IPV6 mode, IsIPv4Address() no longer returns true for
     IPv4 addresses ::1 and ::, as these are commonly used IPv6 addresses.
   * Fixed two bugs that could cause StorageReflectSession do do subscription
     updating incorrectly when using QueryFilters in the subscriptions.

4.63 Released 7/17/2009
   - When compiled with MUSCLE_USE_IPV6 enabled, MUSCLE now does automatic
     transparent remapping of IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses into IPv4-mapped
     IPv6 addresses.  This allows MUSCLE servers to be 100% compatible with
     both IPv4 and IPv6 clients (on platforms that support dual stacks, of
     course) without any additional effort on the programemr's part.
   - Added SetAutomaticIPv4AddressMappingEnabled() and
     GetAutomaticIPv4AddressMappingEnabled() calls to
     NetworkUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.
   - Added CAdd*() and CPrepend*() convenience methods to the Message
     API, to the common "add value to Message unless it's the default value"
     idiom quicker and easier to express.
   - Added Contains() convenience methods to the String class.
   - Added an optional (optRetTotal) argument to
     SharedUsageLimitProxyMemoryAllocator::GetCurrentMemoryUsage().
   - Added a ParseHumanReadableTimeIntervalString() convenience function
     to MiscUtilityFunctions.cpp.
   - Added an static Exists() method to the Directory class.
   - Added a PutOrRemove() convenience method to the Hashtable class.
   - Added an IsValidIP() function to NetworkUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.
   - GetNextEventFromInternalThread() now has an optLocation parameter that
     can be used to find out the IP address and port that a session connected
     to (or what accepted from).
   - The SessionConnected() signals of the QMessageTransceiverThread and
     QMessageTransceiverHandler classes now include an IPAddressAndPort object
     indicating what the session connected to.
   - The SessionAccepted() signal of the QMessageTransceiverThread class now
     includes an IPAddressAndPort object indicating where the session was accepted from.
   - Added SetAsyncConnectDestination() and GetAsyncConnectDestination() methods
     to the AbstractReflectSession class.
   - Added ToString() methods to the SegmentedStringMatcher and
     StringMatcher classes.
   - SegmentedStringMatcher no longer bothers to allocate a StringMatcher
     object for clauses that are represented by "*".
   o Renamed DataNode::CountChildren() to DataNode::GetNumChildren().
   o Renamed DataNode::SetMaxKnownChildID() to DataNode::SetMaxKnownChildIDHint().
   o Renamed Message::CountNames() to Message::GetNumNames().
   o Rewrote the static internal function AdjustValue() in
     SharedUsageLimitAllocator.cpp to give more informative error output.
   o Removed Message::GetConstPointer() since you can use GetPointer()
     to do the same thing (by assigning a const pointer to the result).
   o Documented some methods that were previously not documented.
   * Fixed a bug where SharedUsageLimitAllocator::ResetDaemonCounter()
     could push the cumulative memory counter into negative territory.
   * Inet_NtoA was allowing the IPv6-specific "@3" interface-index
     suffix into IPv4-style address strings.  Fixed.
   * SetupSystem.cpp's Muscle_GetCurrentThread() wasn't working properly
     on 64-bit OS's.  Fixed.

4.62 Released 6/17/2009
  - Added a ThreadLocalStorage class to the muscle/system
    sub-folder.  This class makes it easy for each thread
    to access its own local copy of a global object, without
    any need for Mutex locking/unlocking overhead.
  - Added a Thread::GetCurrentThread() static method, so that
    any Thread can access its Thread object conveniently.
  - Added additional fields to the PR_RESULT_PARAMETERS Message:
    PR_NAME_SERVER_CURRENTTIMEUTC   (server's GetCurrentTime(UTC))
    PR_NAME_SERVER_CURRENTTIMELOCAL (server's GetCurrentTime(LOCAL))
    PR_NAME_SERVER_RUNTIME          (server's GetRunTime64())
  - Added a AddApplicationSpecificParametersToParametersResultMessage()
    method to the StorageReflectSession class.  It allows a subclass
    to add fields to the PR_RESULT_PARAMETERS Message before it
    goes back to the client.
  - Added an IsIPv4Address() function to NetworkUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}
  - Added GetSendDestinations() methods to the UDPSocketDataIO object.
    With these methods you can have the UDPSocketDataIO object send the
    same UDP packet to multiple destinations whenever Write() is called.
  - Added a GetDefaultItem() method to the Queue class.
  - Added GetDefaultKey() and GetDefaultValue() methods to the
    Hashtable class.
  - If TARGET_PLATFORM_XENOMAI is defined, GetRunTime64() now
    uses Xenomai's rt_timer_read() function to determine its result.
  - GetNetworkInterfaceInfos() and GetNetworkInterfaceAddresses() now
    accept a bit-chord of GNII_INCLUDE_* bits as their second argument,
    rather than a simple boolean.  This allows the caller to express
    in a bit more detail which sorts of interfaces he is interested in.
  - Added a convenience constructor to the AndOrQueryFilter class.
  o Added testthread.cpp back in to the test/Makefile.
  o Modified testthread.cpp to test the ThreadLocalStorage class also.
  o Reorganized the ObjectPool.h class implementation.
  o Simplified the Qt implementation of the Thread class.
  * system/Mutex.h now #includes support/MuscleSupport.h,
    so that the Win32 build environment is detected properly
    even when system/Mutex.h is the first #include.

4.61 Released 5/22/2009
  - Added GetTotalNumSignalsReceived() and
    GetNumSignalsReceivedOfType() methods to the
    SignalMultiplexer class.
  - Added an IsCurrentThreadMainThread() function to
    SetupSystem.{cpp,h}.
  - Added support for a "catchsignals" keyword to
    HandleStandardDaemonArgs().  This keyword, if
    specified, will cause the main thread's
    ReflectSession() (if any) to add a signal handler
    session to itself.
  - Added support for a MUSCLE_AVOID_SIGNAL_HANDLING compiler
    flag that can be defined by applications that don't
    want to compile in signal handling support.
  - Added a SignalChildProcess() method to the
    ChildProcessDataIO class.
  - ChildProcessDataIO::WaitForChildProcessToExit()
    now takes an optional timeout value, and returns
    true if the child exited or false if it timed out.
  - In the ChildProcessDataIO class, I replaced
    SetKillChildOnClose() and SetWaitForChildOnClose() with
    a single SetChildProcessShutdownBehavior() method which
    provides for more flexibility, making it possible to
    do a "soft shutdown with a hard kill after a timeout".
  o Removed the "catchsignals" support from muscledMain()'s
    setup code, since that support is now part of
    HandleStandardDaemonArgs() instead.

4.60 Released 5/15/2009
  - The Message class now derives from Cloneable.
  - The Message::FindInt*() methods class now accept both
    signed and unsigned value arguments, so that dangerous
    C-style casting is no longer necessary when retrieving
    unsigned integer values.
  - Added a set of Message::Get*() methods that are similar to
    Message::Find*() except that they return the found value
    instead of a status code.  (if the requested value is not found,
    they return a user-provided default value instead)
  - The Message::Find*() methods now take their value parameters
    by reference instead of by pointer.
    (e.g. msg.FindInt8("foo", x) instead of msg.FindInt8("foo", &x).
    The old by-pointer style is still supported, but is deprecated.
  - Added a Queue::LastIndexOf() method that does a reverse
    search in a Queue, optionally within a specified index range.
  - Added a Flattenable::UnflattenFromByteBuffer() method
    that takes a ConstByteBufferRef argument, per Mika's request.
  - Added SetLowBits(), SetHighBits() to the IPv6 ip_address class.
  - When MUSCLE_USE_IPV6 is defined, the ip_address class now
    includes an interface-address field.  Inet_AtoN() and Inet_NtoA()
    now append/expect this field at the end of the string if the
    interface is non-zero (e.g. "fe80::1@3")
  - Upgraded the multicast API to properly support IPv6 multicast.
    In particular, when MUSCLE_USE_IPV6 is defined,
    AddSocketToMulticastGroup() and RemoveSocketFromMulticastGroup()
    no longer take an interface IP address (instead they use the
    interface index included in the groupAddress argument).
    Also SetSocketMulticastSendInterfaceAddress() and
    GetSocketMulticastSendInterfaceAddress() are replaced by
    SetSocketMulticastSendInterfaceIndex() and
    GetSocketMulticastSendInterfaceIndex().  This is necessary
    because IPv6 doesn't identify interfaces by IP address,
    rather it identifies them with integers.
  - Added a broadcastIP_IPv4 constant to NetworkUtilityFunctions.h
    to allow IPv4 braodcasts even in IPv6 mode.
  - Added a localhostIP_IPv4 constant to NetworkUtilityFunctions.h
    to allow references to the IPv4 localhost device in IPv6 mode.
  - Added a GetHashCodeForIPAddress() function to
    NetworkUtilityFunctions.h, to avoid #ifdefs in application code.
  - Added a IsMulticastIPAddress(const ip_address &) function
    to NetworkUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h} that returns true iff the
    specified address is a multicast addess.
  - Added a IsStandardLoopbackDeviceAddress(const ip_address &)
    function to NetworkUtilityFunctions.h, since under IPv6
    localhostIP has several names and thus doing a literal
    numeric comparison to (localhostIP) can be error-prone.
  - Added a GetConnectString(const String &, uint16) convenience
    function to MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}, to generate strings
    like "localhost:9999" or "[ff05::1]:9999" correctly.
  - Added an ExecuteSynchronousMessageRPCCall() function to
    MessageIOGateway.{cpp,h}.  This function connects to a
    server via TCP, sends a Message, received a Message,
    and returns the received Message, so that you can "call"
    a server, RPC-style, as if it was a local function.
  - Added a GetLocalHostName() function to
    NetworkUtilifyFunctions.{cpp,h}.
  - Added a HashCode64() method to the String class, and a
    CStringHashFunc64() function that it calls.
  - Added a ToString() method to the NetworkInterfaceInfo class.
  - Improved the parsing of IPAddressAndPort and ParseConnectArg()
    so that they now properly handle IPv6 hostname-and-port
    strings that don't contain brackets, when possible.
  - Added a version of ParseConnectArg() that takes a direct
    String (instead of a Message and field name)
  - Rewrite the Win32 implementation of GetNetworkInterfaceInfos()
    to use GetAdaptersAddresses() instead of GetIpAddrTable(),
    so that it can detect IPv6 addresses as well as IPv4.
  - Added an optional (preferIPv4Style) argument to Inet_NtoA()
    so that if you prefer, IPv4 addresses can be returned in the
    classic style ("192.168.1.1") instead of new-style ("::192.168.1.1")
  - Added support for the MUSCLE_INCLUDE_SOURCE_LOCATION_IN_LOGTIME
    compiler flag, which if specified will cause every call to
    LogTime() to include location info (source file name and line
    number) in the log information.  This can be useful for
    tracking down exactly where a particular log message came from.
  - When MUSCLE_INCLUDE_LOCATION_IN_LOGTIME is defined, the
    standard log-line preamble now includes the string returned
    by GetStandardLogLinePreamble().
  - Added GenerateSourceCodeLocationKey(),
    SourceCodeLocationKeyToString(), and
    SourceCodeLocationKeyFromString() functions to Syslog.{cpp,h}
  - Added a utility called "findsourcelocations" to the tests folder.
    This utility will find possible locations for source code keys
    in the specified directory hierarchy.
  - Added a HashCode() method to the NetworkInterfaceInfo class.
  - The Directory class is now a subclass of RefCountable.
  - Added a GetPath() method to the Directory class.
  - Added FileExists(), RenameFile(), CopyFile(), and DeleteFile()
    utility functions to util/MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.
  - Added an MEXIT(ret,msg) macro to MuscleSupport.h.  It's
    the same as MCRASH, but it doesn't crash, it merely ends
    the process (by calling ExitWithoutCleanup(ret)).
  - Added a Reset() method to the StringMatcher class.
  - Added a WasConnected() method to AbstractReflectSession,
    so that subclasses can find out if the session ever was
    connected to its remote peer.
  - ExpandLocalhostAddress() now caches its first result from
    GetNetworkInterfaceInfos() so that it no longer has to
    call GetNetworkInterfaceInfos() every time it is called.
  - Added a GetServerSessionID() method to the ReflectServer
    class, and a PR_NAME_SERVER_SESSION_ID field to the
    standard parameters set, so that clients can access a
    64-bit value that is unique to the current server instance.
  - Added a SignalMultiplexer class that deals with POSIX
    signals or Windows Console signalling in a unified manner.
  - Added a QSignalHandler class that can emit a Qt signal
    when a POSIX/Windows signal is received.
  - Added a SignalHandlerSession class that you can add
    to your ReflectServer if you want signals to result
    in a graceful shutdown (or other custom behavior)
  - The Python MessageTransceiverThread class constructor
    now takes a boolean argument which indicates whether or
    not it should use IPv6 networking.
  - Added a GetHumanReadableProgramNameFromArgv0(const char *)
    convenience function to MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.
  - Added a Win32AllocateStdioConsole() function that allocates
    a console window for stdio to use under Windows.
  - Added CleanupDNSLabel() and CleanupDNSPath() functions to
    MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.  These are handy for removing
    errors from user-entered DNS hostnames (e.g. "www.foo.com").
  - Rewrote String::LastIndexOf(char) and the String -=
    operators to be more efficient.
  o The arguments to the Log() method in the LogCallback API
    are now consolidated into a single LogCallbackArgs object,
    for efficiency and cleaner code.
  o The GetStandardLogLinePreamble() function now takes a
    single LogCallbackArgs argument instead of separate args also.
  o Removed support for the MUSCLE_AVOID_NAMESPACES,
    BEGIN_NAMESPACE, END_NAMESPACE, and USING_NAMESPACE
    macros, since they aren't necessary and use of macros to
    control namespaces can confuse Qt's moc utility.
  o Rewrote portablereflectclient to use StdinDataIO instead
    of accessing stdin directly.  This allows it to work
    correctly under Windows, and simplifies the code.
  o Queue::IndexOf() was defined as returning the last
    matching item, which was inconsistent.  Replaced it with
    a new IndexOf() implementation that does a forward search,
    optionally within a specified index range.
  o Suppressed a warning in zip.c
  o Removed the explicit signal handling from the ReflectServer
    class (SetSignalHandlingEnabled() and WasSignalCaught() are
    gone now).  This functionality is now handled by the
    SignalHandlerSession class instead.
  * The Win32 "console" keyword wasn't redirecting stdin.  Fixed.
  * Fixed a syntax error in the EnsureRefIsPrivate() method.
  * Updated the VC++ project files so they build again.
  * ParseConnectArg() now handles the "[ipv6::addr]:port"
    syntax properly when MUSCLE_USE_IPV6 is defined.
  * Fixed a bug in the PulseChild class that would sometimes
    prevent the GetPulseTime() method of grandchild PulseChild
    nodes from getting called after InvalidatePulseTime() was
    called on them.
  * AbstractReflectClient::Reconnect() now sets the _wasConnected
    flag to false.
  * Fixed a bug in MessageTransceiverThread::AddNewWorkerConnectSession()
    that was causing disconnect notifications not to be sent for
    connect-sessions whose connections failed synchronously.
  * IntCompareFunc() was taking an int8 argument by mistake.  Fixed.

4.51 Released 3/19/2009
  - Added GetByteBufferFromPool() functions that accept a Flattenable
    object as an argument, for convenience.
  - Added a Message::GetPointerToNormalizedFieldData() method, which
    is useful if you need efficient direct (array-style) access to
    the contents of a data field in a Message object.
  - Added NumericAwareStringCompareFunc() functions to String.{cpp,h}.
    These routines are based on Martin Pool's number-aware string
    compare code, and compare strings in such a way that numbers in
    the strings are sorted properly.
  - Added a SegmentedStringMatcher class to the regex folder, for
    easy multi-level regex matching in e.g. file paths.
  - Added GetStringMatcherFromPool() convenience functions to
    regex/StringMatcher.{cpp,h}.
  - Added a ParseHexBytes() convenience function to
    MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}
  - Added a PrintToStream() method to the ByteBuffer class.
  - Added Bryan Varner's UDPClient class to the Java archive.
    This class facilitates sending small MUSCLE Messages over UDP
    in Java programs.  Thanks Bryan!
  - Added Bryan Varner's DatagramPacketTransceiver class to the
    Java archive.  This class allow Java applications
    to send large MUSCLE Messages over UDP in Java programs,
    by breaking them up into multiple chunks that are sent in
    successive UDP packets and then re-assembled by the receiver.
    This class is compatible with MUSCLE's C++ PacketTunnelIOGateway
    class.  Thanks again, Bryan!
  - Added LaunchChildProcess() and System() methods to the
    ChildProcessDataIO class that takes a Queue<String> as an
    argument, for convenience.
  - Added implementations of ParseArg(), ParseArgs(), ParseFile(),
    and UnparseArgs() that take a Queue<String> to hold the parsed
    arguments rather than a Message.  This is useful in cases where
    argument ordering must be preserved 100%.
  - Added a Directory::MakeDirectoryForFile() convenience method.
    It creates a directory for the specified file to be created in.
  - Added Monni's 64-bit x86 byte-swap routine to MuscleX86SwapInt64().
  o RemoveEscapeChars() and EscapeRegexTokens() now take a const
    String and return a String.  This makes them easier to use
    in nested function calls.
  o Repackaged the com.lcs.* Java hierarchy as com.meyer.*, to reflect
    my company's name change.
  o Removed the Visual Cafe project from the archive, as it is obsolete
    and I am no longer using Visual Cafe and thus cannot easily update it.
  * Fixed template problems with gcc4 in BThread.h and AThread.h
  * The Windows implementation of StdinDataIO now freopens stdin
    as "nul", so that no other code will try to access stdin.  This
    was done to keep third party libraries (read: Python 2.6) from
    trying to muck with stdin while the StdinDataIO thread was using
    and getting hung up.

4.50 Released 1/28/2009
  - NullDataIO's constructor now takes an optional ConstSocketRef
    argument, to let you specify the value that its GetSelectSocket()
    method should return.
  - Added a GetMessageFromPool(const ByteBuffer &) inline
    convenience function.
  - Added another AddNewSession() convenience method to the
    MessageTransceiverThread class.
  - In the Message class, MoveName(), CopyName(), and ShareName()
    all now take an optional target-field-name parameter, in case
    you want to have a different field name in the target Message.
  - Added an EnsureFieldIsPrivate(const String & fieldName) method
    to the Message class.  This method is useful to avoid side effects
    when modifying possibly-shared Message fields' contents.
  - Added an "cleanup callbacks queue" to the CompleteSetupSystem
    class, so that you can specify actions that should be taken as
    part of the CompleteSetupSystem destructor's cleanup steps.
  - Added a static GetCurrentCompleteSetupSystem() method to the
    CompleteSetupSystem class, to make it easier for code to find
    the current CompleteSetupSystem object.
  - Added MUSCLE_CATCH_SIGNALS_BY_DEFAULT #ifdefs... if this
    is set, ReflectServer will enable Control-C detection (and
    graceful shutdowns) by default.
  - GetOSName() now accepts an optional string value to return in
    the case where it can't determine the local OS name.
  - Added a MUSCLE_UNIQUE_NAME macro to MuscleSupport.h which will
    evaluate to a unique identifier based on the line number that the
    macro is invoked on.
  - Added a DECLARE_ANONYMOUS_STACK_OBJECT macro to MuscleSupport.h
    to allow easy declaration of anonymous objects on the stack.
  - Added util/BatchOperator.h, which contains the BatchOperator
    and BatchOperatorGuard utility classes that help automate the
    amortization of setup/shutdown routines across a nested call
    tree, for more efficient batch processing.
  - Added a DECLARE_BATCHGUARD() macro for each declaration of
    batched areas of code.
  - Added a DECLARE_MUTEXGUARD(m) macro to support declaring an
    anonymous MutexGuard on the stack in a simple and foolproof way.
  - hexterm now automatically enables the UDP broadcast flag on its
    UDP socket when the specified UDP address is a broadcast address.
  - Added a Cloneable interface in util/Cloneable.h, and updated
    ConstRefCount::EnsureRefIsPrivate() to use it when appopriate.
  - Added a Clone() method to the ConstRefCount class, for easy
    copying of referenced items.
  - Redesigned hexterm to be Win32 compatible.
  - Added a hexterm.vcproj file to the tests folder, to compile
    hexterm under Win32/VC++.
  - Added a "child=" option to hexterm so it can spawn and communicate
    with a child process if you want it to.
  - Added a "ascii" keyword argument to hexterm so you can send
    and receive data in ASCII format rather than hex, if you prefer.
  - Added LogHexBytes() functions to MiscUtilityFunctions.h.  These
    are the same as PrintHexBytes() except that they call through
    to Log() instead of directly to fprintf().
  - Added an optional (portRequired) argument to ParseConnectArg().
  - Added SetLogFileName()/GetLogFileName() to util/SysLog.{cpp,h}.
  - Added a standard "logfile" keyword so you can specify the name
    and/or location of a log file to write the log to.
  - Added a WaitForChildProcessToExit() method to the
    ChildProcessDataIO class.
  - Added ChildProcessDataIO::System() static convenience methods.
  - Added a Directory::DeleteDirectory() static convenience method.
  o Rolled in Mika Lindqvist's Haiku-compatibility patches.
  o Renamed the standard "log" and "display" keywords to "filelevel"
    and "displaylevel", respectively.
  o Removed the OutOfMemoryCallback and FunctionOutOfMemoryCallback
    classes and replaced them with more general-purpose
    GenericCallback and FunctionGenericCallback classes.
  o Tweaked a call to FD_ISSET() in system/Thread.cpp in order to
    avoid a compiler warning under g++ 4.3.1
  o Tweaked the _PLOCKimp and _PUNLOCKimp debug functions to compile
    properly in 64-bit environments.
  o Updated the Message.h Doxygen documentation with some more
    descriptive parameter names.
  o hexterm no longer disables multicast-to-self when sending
    multicast UDP packets.
  o Removed DebugTimer.cpp; that code has moved to SetupSystem.cpp.
  o Updated all copyright notice headers to read 2000-2009 Meyer Sound.
  * DebugTimer now uses GetRunTime64() if MUSCLE_USE_LIBRT is defined.
  * Fixed some #ifdef problems involving the stat64() call in
    FilePathInfo.h.  FilePathInfo.h should now compile under both
    32-bit and 64-bit environments.
  * JeffK added a macosx.mak file to the muscle/zlib/zlib folder,
    to support creation of universal binaries that include zlib.
  * MuscleSupport.h now checks a much more exhaustive list of
    Intel-compatible processor-type macros before deciding that
    inline x86 assembly code is not an option.  In particular,
    compiling with an __i686__ target now does the right thing.
  * Fixed a potential infinite recursion in
    Thread::WaitForNextMessageAux().
  * Tweaked the SharedMemory.h include directives to compile
    more reliably under Win32.
  * Updated the #ifdefs in MuscleSupport.h to define int64's
    and uint64's properly under 64-bit Ubuntu Linux.
  * Rewrote the Win32 implementation of StdinDataIO to be simpler
    and more reliable.
  * The Win32 implementation of the INT64_FORMAT_SPEC macros
    was incorrect.  Fixed it to do the right thing.
  * Made ChildProcessDataIO::LaunchChildProcess() const-correct.
  * ChildProcessDataIO::LaunchChildProcess() now specifies the
    application name to launch, when possible, for better security.
    (See Microsoft's CreateProcess() man page for details)

4.41 Released 11/17/2008
  - Added an implementation of PrintHexBytes() that takes a
    Queue<uint8> as an argument.
  - Added GetArchiveMessageFromPool() functions to Message.{cpp,h}.
    These templated convenience functions let you convert any object
    (with a SaveToArchive() method) into a MessageRef with a single command.
  - Added FindArchiveMessage() and FindArchiveMessageWithDefault()
    template methods to the Message class, for convenient one-step
    restoring of archived objects.
  - Added AddArchiveMessage(), PrependArchiveMessage(), and
    ReplaceArchiveMessage() template methods to the Message class,
    for further convenience in archiving objects.
  - GetHumanReadableTimeValues() now writes into a
    HumanReadableTimeValues object instead of into a series
    of by-reference int parameters.  The HumanReadableTimeValues
    object now also includes day-of-week and microsecond fields.
  - Added an ExpandTokens() method to the HumanReadableTimeValues
    class that makes it easy to generate time/date stamps of your
    preferred format using various printf()-style field specifiers.
  * ProxySessionFactory::IsReadyToAcceptSessions() wasn't passing
    the call onto the slave session like it was supposed to.  Fixed.
  * The calls to open() inside SpawnDaemonProcess() now supply a
    mode argument to the open() call.
  * AcceptSocketsThread.cpp wasn't compiling due to a const/non-const
    issue.  Fixed.
  * Fixed several bugs in the admin utility.  Thanks to Monni for
    pointing them out and supplying a patch.

4.40 Released 10/16/2008
  - The Ref class now subclasses from a ConstRef class, which is the
    same as Ref except that it only allows read-only access to the
    held RefCountable object.
  - Added a CastAwayConstFromRef() template function to RefCount.h,
    so you can easily convert a ConstRef to a Ref if you really need to.
  - Renamed the SocketRef class to ConstSocketRef, because it now derives
    from ConstRef<Socket> instead of Ref<Socket>.
  - Added a DECLARE_REFTYPES macro to RefCount.h, which you can
    use to declare the standard BlahRef and ConstBlahRef typedefs
    without having to specify the typedefs manually every time.
  - Added implementations of the Connect() and ConnectAsync() functions
    that take an IPAddressAndPort object as an argument.
  - Added *_FORMAT_SPEC_NOPERCENT macros, for times when I need to
    specify format specifications without the percent sign included.
  - Added an AsyncDataIO class that can be used to transparently forward
    I/O operations to a separate thread, to avoid blocking in your
    main thread.  This can be useful for DataIO classes that don't
    support non-blocking I/O (e.g. FileDataIO)
  - Added a GetStackTrace() function to SysLog.{cpp,h} that returns
    the current stack trace as a String.
  - Added GetLightweightCopyOfMessage() convenience functions to
    Message.{cpp,h}.
  - Added convenience methods FindFirstSessionOfType() and
    FindSessionsOfType() to the ServerComponent class.  These
    methods are templated to let you quickly find and collect
    one or more atatched session objects of the specified C++ class.
  o Renamed GenericRef to RefCountableRef, for consistency.
  o Renamed PolicyRef to AbstractSessionIOPolicyRef, for consistency.
  o Renamed Ref::SetFromGeneric() and Ref::GetGeneric() to
    Ref::SetFromRefCountableRef() and Ref::GetRefCountableRef(),
    respectively, for consistency.
  o testrefcount now runs a 10-second test of reference-counts in a
    heavily multithreaded environment, to ensure that they are thread safe.
  o Improved performance of Tuple::ShiftValuesLeft() and
    Tuple::ShiftValuesRight().
  * Removed re-definitions of 'true' and 'false' when compiling in C++ mode.
  * Added some missing command codes to StorageReflectConstants.py.
  * Message.py didn't handle B_INT32_TYPE fields properly when running on
    a 64-bit host.  Fixed.
  * AddNewConnectSession() and Reconnect() now handle synchronous connect
    failures the same way as asynchronous connect failures, so that the
    calling code doesn't have to worry about two different failure modes.
  * Fixed a valgrind hit in CreateAcceptingSocket() on 64-bit platforms.
  * Fixed a buffer overflow bug in Message::AddToString().
  * Updated the header comments to fix various doxygen warnings.

4.30 Released 9/18/2008
  *** WARNING - THIS RELEASE CHANGES THE PulseNode API IN a NON  ***
  *** BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE WAY.  BE SURE TO READ THE ENTRY ABOUT ***
  *** PulseNode BELOW AND UPDATE YOUR CODE TO MATCH THE NEW API. ***
  - ChildProcessDataIO class now has SetChildProcessInheritFileDescriptors()
    and GetChildProcessInheritFileDescriptors() methods to control whether
    child processes spawned should inherit the parent's file descriptors or
    not.  Note that these methods have no effect under Windows.
  - When receiving UDP packets, hexterm now prints out the source of the
    UDP packets it received (in addition to the data).
  - Added a IsNormalized() method to the Queue class.
  - Added a IsMessageDeflated() method to ZLibUtilityFunctions.h.
  - Added Message::BecomeLightWeightCopyOf(const Message &), for making
    lightweight copies of Messages, with shared fields.
  - Added Message::ShareName() (like CopyName() except the data isn't
    copied, rather only a reference is shared)
  - Added Queue::AddHeadAndGet() and Queue::AddTailAndGet() methods,
    for when you want to add an item to a Queue and then write to the
    added object directly afterwards.
  - Added an optional (retPort) argument to
    MessageTransceiverThread::PutAcceptFactory() so that you can now
    use dynamic port assignment with it.
  o PulseNode::GetPulseTime() and PulseNode::Pulse() now take a single
    (const PulseArgs &) argument instead of two uint64s.  This makes
    implementing the PulseNode interface less verbose, and calling
    the Pulse callbacks more efficient.  However, this breaks compatibility
    with earlier code that expects (uint64, uint64) arguments for those
    methods, so be sure to update your code when upgrading to this
    version of MUSCLE.
  o Fixed some compiler warnings under gcc (thanks to Monni for pointing
    these out)
  o Trying to use MUSCLE's logging system when there is not a SetupSystem
    object on the stack (e.g. before or after main()) is no longer a fatal error.
    Instead, muscle will degrade to output only to the built-in log services
    (stdout and/or output-to-file) when called under these conditions.

4.28 Released 8/26/2008
  - Added a RefCount::IsDeeplyEqualTo() method for more in-depth
    comparison-by-value of the referenced items.  (The regular RefCount::==
    operator only compares the pointers, not the items themselves)
  - Added a Directory class (util/Directory.{cpp,h}) to support directory
    scanning in a cross-platform-compatible fashion.
  - Added a FilePathInfo class (util/FilePathInfo.h) to support
    stat() functionality in a cross-platform-compatible manner.
  - ReflectServer::SetSignalHandlingEnabled() now enables/disables
    handling of console signal events (Ctrl-C, etc) under Win32.
  - Added implementations of GetMessageFromPool() that take a
    pointer and a byte-count and try to return a Message that has
    been unflattened from the specified byte array.
  - ChildProcessDataIO::LaunchChildProcess() now takes an optional
    boolean (usePty) argument that allows you to specify at runtime
    whether you want to use fork() or forkpty() to launch the child
    process.
  - Added a MUSCLE_AVOID_FORKPTY compiler flag that tells the
    ChildProcessDataIO class to avoid compiling in calls forkpty().
  o Made the AbstractReflectSession::EndSession() method virtual.
  o The Win32 build of MUSCLE now #includes winsock2.h instead of winsock.h.
  * The Win32 implementation of StdinDataIO wasn't handling a closed
    stdin connection correctly.  Fixed.
  * For the Win32 build, added Microsoft's recommended work-around for
    the WSAECONNRESET problem with UDP sockets, as described at
    http://support.microsoft.com/kb/263823/en-us
  * Fixed the Hashtable and Queue classes to again compile under
    Visual C++ 6.0  (thanks to Mika Lindqvist for the patch)

4.27 Released 7/24/2008
  - minichatclient.c now advertises the client's host OS on the server.
  - PrintStackTrace() is now implemented under MacOS/X (Leopard or newer).
  - PrintStackTrace() and all implementations of PrintToStream()
    now take an optional (FILE *) argument, so that they can now
    print to places other than stdout if you prefer.
  - The testchildprocess test program now has you specify the number
    of child process instances to run.  That makes it easier to test
    what happens when many child processes are launched in parallel.
  o Merged in some more of Mika Lindqvist's Haiku compatibility tweaks.
  o Hashtable::GetByDefault() with one parameter now returns its result
    by reference instead of by value.
  o The Hashtable and Queue classes now keep default instances of
    their user types, to avoid having to construct temporary default
    objects when resetting objects to their default state.
  * PrintStackTrace() now prints appropriate error messages if
    it fails, instead of just failing siliently.
  * Fixed a syntax error in Hashtable::Remove(const Hashtable &)
  * Hashtable::Clear() now handles re-entrancy (from the templatized
    classes' assignment operators) correctly.

4.26 Released 6/5/2008
  - Added a CheckedGetItemPointer() method to the Ref class.
    This method is the same as GetItemPointer(), but with
    an additional check so that it will safely return NULL
    if the "this" pointer is NULL.
  - Added a "assumeDefaultValue" argument to the NumericQueryFilter,
    StringQueryFilter, and RawDataQueryFilter classes.  This
    argument lets you specify that in the event that a Message
    doesn't contain the data item the QueryFilter wants to
    compare against, a default value should be compared against
    instead.
  - Added a HashCode() method to the Ref class, for consistency.
  - ChildProcessDataIO::GetChildProcessID() is now implemented
    under Windows as well.
  - Added two new conditional defines to MuscleSupport.h:
    MUSCLE_USING_OLD_MICROSOFT_COMPILER, which is defined when
    compiling under VC++6 or earlier, and
    MUSCLE_USING_NEW_MICROSOFT_COMPILER, which is defined
    when compiling under VC++.net(2003) or later.  These make
    managing Microsoft's bug circus a bit a easier.
  * Fixed the Ref class to compile under MSVC2005 again.
  * Fixed the setsockopt()/getsockopt() calls in NetworkUtilityFunctions.cpp
    so that they again compile under Windows.
  * Merged in Mika Lindqvist's patches so that muscle compiles
    properly under Haiku.

4.25 Released 5/14/2008
  - Added a DECLARE_HASHTABLE_KEY_CLASS macro that expands
    to the boilerplate template code necessary to use the
    specified class as a key in a Hashtable.
  - Added a DECLARE_HASHTABLE_KEY_CLASS_IN_NAMESPACE macro
    which is the same as DECLARE_HASHTABLE_KEY_CLASS except
    it works from within namespaces other than muscle.
  - Added PutIfNotAlreadyPresent() convenience methods to the
    Hashtable class.
  - Added CopyFrom() method to the Queue and Hashtable classes.
    These work the same as the assignment operator, except that
    they return a status_t result code.
  - Added a SetFilter() method to the PathMatcherEntry class.
  o Cleaned up the setsockopt() and getsockopt() calls inside
    NetworkUtilityFunctions.cpp to be more portable.
  * ExplandLocalhostAddress() is now more careful not to expand
    (localhostIP) back into (localhostIP), even if that is the
    first IP address listed in the interfaces list.
  * Fixed a bug in the QueryFilter subscriptions feature --
    after replacing a subscription's existing QueryFilter,
    the old QueryFilter would continue to be used instead
    of the new one.

4.24 Released 4/28/2008
  - If MUSCLE_USE_LIBRT and _POSIX_MONOTONIC_CLOCK are defined,
    GetRunTime64() and Snooze64() will now use librt's high-resolution
    functions (clock_gettime() and clock_nanosleep()) instead of
    the older vanilla POSIX functions.  This can provides higher
    resolution timing on platforms that support librt.
  - Added a new ExecuteSynchronousMessaging() virtual method
    to the AbstractMessageIOGateway class, and some associated
    hook/callback methods.  This method lets you easily do
    synchronous/RPC-style "function calls" across the gateway's
    socket, passing in one or more Message objects as the
   "arguments", and receiving one or more Messages as "results".
  - MessageIOGateway now overrides ExecuteSynchronousMessaging(),
    IsStillWaitingForSynchronizedReply(), and
    SynchronousMessageReceivedFromGateway() so that when you
    call ExecuteSynchronousMessaging() on it you will get
    proper RPC function-call semantics.
  - Added an IsReadyToAcceptSessions() virtual method to the
    AbstractReflectSessionFactory class.  Subclasses can override
    this method to return false if they don't want to accept
    any more connections for a while.
  - Added an IsConnected() method to the AbstractReflectSession
    class, to make it easier to check if a given session is
    currently connected to anything or not.
  - Added an XorDataIO class to the dataio folder.
    XorDataIO XOR's all the data going through it, before
    forwarding the method call to its held child DataIO object.
  - Added a MutexGuard class that you can put on the stack
    to automatically lock/unlock a Mutex via its ctor/dtor.
  - Added versions of ReadZipFile() and WriteZipFile() that
    take a DataIO reference instead of a file name.  That way
    you can read zip files over the network, through custom
    filters, and so on, if you want to.
    zlib/ZipFileUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.
  - ReadZipFile() now has an optional second argument called
    (loadData).  Setting it false will cause ReadZipFile to
    only read in the file names and uncompressed file lengths,
    but not actually read or uncompress the file data.  This
    is useful if you just want to quickly check the zip file's
    contents without actually unpacking everything.
  - Updated testzip.cpp to accept an optional "namesonly"
    command line argument, which will set (loadData) to
    false in its ReadZipFile() call, as described above.
  - Added a GetNetworkInterfaceAddresses() function, as an
    easier-to-use alternative to GetNetworkInterfaceInfos().
  o Made AbstractReflectSession::IsConnectingAsync() public.
  o Moved Snooze64() from NetworkUtilityFunctions.cpp to
    SetupSystem.cpp, and moved its function declaration from
    NetworkUtilityFunctions.h to TimeUtilityFunctions.h.
  * Joel Lucsy reported a bug in FlattenToDataIO() that would cause
    the last four bytes of the flattened buffer not to be written
    to the DataIO object.  Fixed.
  * Updated zlib's included VC++ project files to reference zconf.h
    in its new location (zlib/win32/zconf.h) so that they now work
    again.

4.23 Released 3/26/2008
  - Added an UnparseArgs() function to MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.
    This function takes a parsed Message and turns it back into a String.
  - Added an InsertItemsAt() method to the Queue class.
  - Added an (includeLocalhost) boolean argument to GetNetworkInterfaceInfos().
  - Made ServerComponent::SetOwner() and ServerComponent::GetOwner()
    public, as it is necessary for classes other than ReflectServer
    to access that value in order to properly support the facade
    pattern within ReflectSessionFactory objects.
  - Added a ProxySessionFactory class to support facade-style
    ReflectSessionFactories better.
  - Added an optional ITraversalPruner argument to both
    StorageReflectSession::SaveNodeTreeToMessage() and
    StorageReflectSession::RestoreNodeTreeFromMessage().  This
    argument lets the caller specify a callback argument that
    can direct the traversal based on custom logic, if necessary.
  o Replaced StorageReflectSession::CloneDataNodeSubtree()'s rather clunky
    MessageReplaceFunc and void-pointer filtering mechanism with the nicer
    and more powerful ITraversalPruner filtering mechanism.
  * Fixed a bug in FilterSessionFactory and SharedFilterSessionFactory
    where an assertion failure would occur if the "slave" factory attempted
    to call GetSessions(), etc.
  * SharedFilterSessionFactory's IP-address checking was broken.  Fixed.
  * AbstractReflectSession::GetPort() was broken and would always
    return 0.  Fixed.

v4.22 Released 3/4/2008
  - Added an IsDaemonProcess() function that returns true iff
    the current process was created via SpawnDaemonProcess()
    or BecomeDaemonProcess().
  - Added a AssembleBatchMessage() convenience function to
    MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.  It's useful for creating a
    PR_COMMAND_BATCH Message from zero or more other Messages.
  - The NestCount class will now cause an assertion failure
    if Decrement() is called when it is already at zero...
    that should never happen in correct code.
  - Added an optional (numColumns) argument to the
    PrintHexBytes() utility function.
  - Added a templatized bit-chord class, support/BitChord.h.
  - Added ReadData() and WriteData() functions to
    NetworkUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.  These are the same
    as SendData() and ReceiveData(), except that they call
    read() and write() instead of send() and recv().
  - Replaced the PrintHexBytes() implementation with the
    superior one from hexterm.cpp.
  - Added a GetWithDefault() convenience method to the
    Hashtable class.
  o Moved the Win32 version of zconf.h from zlib/zlib to
    zlib/zlib/Win32, so that it wouldn't show up in SVN
    as modified whenever the configure script modified it.
  o Changed the default value of MUSCLE_POOL_SLAB_SIZE to
    4 kilobytes, to reduce memory overhead somewhat.  This
    value coincides nicely with the most common memory page size.
  * The POSIX implementation of RS232DataIO was broken, because
    it was trying to use SendData() and ReceiveData() on the
    serial port's (non-sock) fd.  Changed it to call ReadData()
    and WriteData() instead.
  * Rewrote the Unix implementation of ChildProcessDataIO to
    call forkpty() instead of doing everything by hand.  This
    makes the implementation much simpler and more reliable,
    although of course it will only work on systems that have
    forkpty() available.
  * ChildProcessDataIO now closes any forked file handles in the
    child process before calling exec().
  * Made the PacketTunnelIOGateway parsing more flexible;
    duplicate packets no longer break a logical stream.
  * Removed several files from the zlib/zlib folder that are
    meant to be generated by the configure script.

v4.21 Released 1/22/2008
  - Optimized Hashtable::GetOrPut(), CopyToTable(), MoveToTable(),
    Put(), and Remove() to be more efficient.
  o Updated the muscle.dox DOxygen file to reflect changes to
    newer versions of DOxygen
  * Hashtable::Put() and Hashtable::Remove() now do the right
    thing if they are passed (*this) as an argument.
  * Fixed a nasty bug in the ObjectPool destructor that would
    cause it to go into an infinite loop, calling delete on
    the same array over and over again.
  * Filled in and fixed up the DOxygen comments to the point where
    DOxygen no longer gives any warnings when generating the autodocs.
  o Updated all copyright notice headers to read 2000-2008 Meyer Sound.

v4.20 Released 12/31/2007
  - Added an optional set of multicast networking API calls
    to util/NetworkUtilityFunctions.h.  Define the constant
    MUSCLE_ENABLE_MULTICAST_API to make them available.
  - hexterm will now automatically use multicast UDP if you
    specify a multicast UDP address as an argument.  For example,
      ./hexterm udp=239.255.1.2:4001
  - Added SetSourceExclusionID() and GetSourceExclusionID()
    methods to the PacketTunnelIOGateway class, to enable more
    efficient filtering of looped-back broadcast/multicast packets
    that you sent out and don't want to see back again.
  - Added a ParseHexBytes() function to MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}
  - Under Linux, HandleStandardDaemonArgs() now takes a new argument
    "debugcrashes" which will cause a signal handler to be installed
    that will catch SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGILL, SIGABRT, and SIGFPE,
    and print a stack trace to stdout before exiting.
  - Added RemoveFirst() and RemoveLast() convenience methods
    to the Hashtable class (handy when using the Hashtable as
    a keyed FIFO or LRU)
  o Moved the PrintHexBytes() function into system/SetupSystem.cpp
    so that you don't have to link in MiscUtilityFunctions.cpp
    just to use it.
  * Tweaked FinalizeAsyncConnect() to work properly under BeOS.
  * Improved the BeOS/BONE detection -- Makefile support no
    longer required.

v4.11 Released 12/11/2007
  - GetHumanReadableTimeString() and ParseHumanReadableTimeString()
    now handle the uint64 value MUSCLE_TIME_NEVER as a special case,
    by translating it into the string "(never)" (and back).
  - Added a CalculateChecksumForUint64(), CalculateChecksumForFloat(),
    and CalculateChecksumForDouble() convenience functions to
    MuscleSupport.h
  - Added a FindFirstMatchingNode() method to the DataNode class,
    which can be used to efficiently look up a descendant node
    based on a relative or absolute path, with or without wildcard
    matching characters.
  - Added a GetRootNode() convenience method to the DataNode class
    which returns the root node of the DataNode tree.
  - Added SetAllowMiscIncomingData() and GetAllowMiscIncomingData()
    methods to the PacketTunnelIOGateway class, so that a UDP socket
    controlled by a PacketTunnelIOGateway can optional receive
    individual (non-packetized) arbitrary UDP packets as well as
    the packetized kind.  This mode is disabled by default.
  - Added a Normalize() method to the Queue class that can be used
    to ensure that the Queue's contents are layed out contiguously
    in memory (like a C array).
  - Added a AddNewDormantConnectSession() method to the ReflectServer
    and ServerComponent classes.  This method is the same as
    AddNewConnectSession() except that the added session will not
    start a TCP connection immediately; instead it will hang out
    and wait for you to call Reconnect() on it.
  - Added a PrintHexBytes() convenience/debugging function to
    MiscUtilityFunctions.h
  o Removed the (countFieldOrder) argument from the
    Message::CalculateChecksum() method.
  o Changed instances of ((uint32)-1) literals to the more proper
    MUSCLE_NO_LIMIT constant in a number of places.
  o Rewrote StorageReflectSession::GetDataNode() as a simple
    inline call-through to FindFirstMatchingNode(), which means
    that GetDataNode() now supports wildcard matching.
  o GetHumanReadableTimeValues() now returns B_ERROR if you pass
    it MUSCLE_TIME_NEVER as a time value (since there is no good
    numeric way to represent infinity).
  o DataNode::PrintToStream() and Message::PrintToStream()
    no longer print this-pointer values in their debug output,
    because doing so makes it harder to diff state dumps
    from different processes.
  o AbstractReflectSession::Reconnect() and SetAutoReconnectDelay()
    can now be used in conjunction with sessions that were not
    added with AddNewConnectSession() also.  In this context, they
    will "reconnect" the session by destroying its gateway and
    DataIO objects and creating new ones by calling
    CreateDefaultSocket() and CreateDataIO().
  * system/AcceptSocketsThread.h was missing a necessary #include
    line.  Thanks to Mika Lindqvist for reporting this.
  * Fixed a bug in DataNode::InsertOrderedChild() that could cause
    the inserted child's node name not to be unique in some
    circumstances.
  * DataNode::PutChild() now takes a (const DataNodeRef &) instead
    of a (DataNodeRef &).
  * Removed the index-order multiplication from most implementations
    of CalculateChecksum(), since including an index-multiplier
    in the checksum makes it inefficient to update a running
    checksum tally when inserting or removing items in the list.
  * The Thread class now closes the internal thread's side of
    the inter-thread socket connection when the internal thread
    hook function exits.  That way the main thread can be notified
    that the child thread has gone away (the main thread's socket
    will select() ready-for-read because of the socket close)

v4.10 Released 10/30/2007
  - Added Bryan Varner's MicroMUSCLE port to the archive, in
    the new java_j2me folder.  MicroMUSCLE is a fork of the
    MUSCLE Java code that is compatible with the J2ME edition
    of Java being used on modern cell phones, etc.  Unlike
    the standard MUSCLE Java API, this version doesn't require
    Java 1.4.x APIs to be supported.
  - Added a GetNumberOfProcessors() function to the SystemInfo.h
    API.  You can call this to find out how many CPU cores the
    computer you are running on has.
  - Made LockLog() and UnlockLog() part of the public MUSCLE
    syslog API, in case you want to use the log mutex in your
    own critical section.
  - Added a CalculateChecksum() utility function to MuscleSupport.h
  - Added CalculateChecksum() functions to the String, ByteBuffer,
    Point, Rect, Message, and DataNode classes.  These methods
    compute a quick checksum on the object's contents which can
    then be used for sanity-checking later on.
  - Added a PrintToStream() method to the DataNode class for
    quick recursive dumping of database subtrees to stdout.
  - Message::PrintToStream() and Message::ToString() now include
    the checksum value of the Message.
  - Added IsInBatch() and IsOutermost() methods to the NestCount
    class, for convenience and code clarity.  (Before they were
    only present in the NestCountGuard class)
  - Added a KillChildProcess() method to the ChildProcessDataIO
    class, for times when you need the child process dead right
    away but you want to keep the socket to it open (so that it
    will error out as if the child process died of its own accord).
  - Added IsDescendantOf() and IsAncestorOf() convenience methods
    to the DataNode class.
  - Added a StringCompareFunc() override to String.h that takes
    (const String *)'s as arguments.  Useful when you want to
    save space in a Hashtable of string-keyed, ref-counted
    objects, by changing the key-type to a pointer to a string
    that is held in the referenced value-objects.
  - Added a Message::FindString() method override that sets a
    pointer-to-a-String, so that you can access the underlying
    String object without having to copy it.
  - Added a ServerComponent::GetSession() override that takes
    a uint32 for the session ID argument.
  - Added convenience versions of StringMatcher::Match()
    and HasRegexTokens() that take a String argument instead
    of a (const char *).
  - Added a GetEmptyMessageRef() convenience function to
    Message.h.  It's like GetEmptyMessage() except it returns
    a (const MessageRef &) instead of a (const Message &).
  - The StdinDataIO class now works as expected under Windows.
    In particular, it implements some backstage trickery so that
    you can use its GetSelectSocket() return value in select()
    even though Windows doesn't support doing that.
  o Removed GetBlankMessage() from the StorageReflectSession
    API.  Use GetEmptyMessageRef() instead.
  o DataNode::GetData() now returns a (const MessageRef &)
    instead of a MessageRef.
  o The GetSessions() method now returns a Hashtable instead
    of a HashtableIterator.
  o The GetNumSessions() method has been removed; use
    GetSessions().GetNumItems() instead.
  o The GetFactories() method now returns a Hashtable instead
    of a HashtableIterator.
  o The GetNumFactories() method has been removed; use
    GetFactories().GetNumItems() instead.
  o Tweaked some of the code to avoid new warnings in gcc 4.1.x
  o The SetDataNode(), FindMatchingSessions(), CloneDataNodeSubtree(),
    NotifySubscribersThatIndexNodeChanged(), NodeIndexChanged(),
    GetNewDataNode(), and JettisonOutgoingSubtrees() methods
    in the StorageReflectSession class not take String arguments
    instead of (const char *)
  o The InsertOrderedChild(), ReorderChild(), HasChild(),
    GetChild(), and RemoveChild() in the DataNode class now all
    take String arguments instead of (const char *).
  o DataNode::GetPathClause() now returns a (const String *)
    instead of a (const char *).
  o FilterSessionFactory Put*Pattern() and Remove*Pattern()
    methods now take (const String &) arguments instead of
    (const char *).
  o The StdinDataIO class no longer derives from the
    FileDescriptorDataIO class.  This way it is possible to
    use StdinDataIO under Windows (which doesn't support
    file descriptors).
  o Moved the StdinDataIO code into its own separate StdinDataIO.cpp
    file, to better hide the ugly Windows implementation.
  * Fixed a VC++ compatibility issue in ObjectPool.h.  Thanks to
    Mika Lindqvist for reporting this problem.
  * Fixed a bug in AcceptSocketsThread.cpp.  Thanks to Mika
    Lindqvist for reporting this problem also.
  * Fixed a HANDLE leak in the Windows implementation of the
    RS232DataIO and ChildProcessDataIO classes.

v4.00 Released 10/03/2007
  *** WARNING - THIS RELEASE RATIONALIZES SEVERAL APIS AND THUS ***
  *** BREAKS SOURCE COMPATIBILITY WITH MOST OLD CODE.  DON'T    ***
  *** UPGRADE TO THIS RELEASE UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO UPDATE  ***
  *** YOUR CODEBASE TO MATCH.                                   ***
  - Added a SanitySetupSystem class to the CompleteSetupSystem
    object.  SanitySetupSystem just does some very quick tests
    on the typedef sizes (int16, int32, etc) and endian-ness
    of the compiled code to make sure that the code's build
    settings are compatible with the run-time environment.
    If any of the tests fail, it prints out a stern error
    message and aborts the program.
  - Added convenience methods for AddFlat(), PrependFlat(),
    FindFlat(), and ReplaceFlat() to the Message class that
    take a ByteBufferRef as an argument.  That way you can
    deal with Messages and ByteBufferRefs without always
    having to look up how to cast a ByteBufferRef to a
    FlatCountableRef and back.
  - Added HasChars() and IsEmpty() convenience methods
    to the String class, for consistency with the other
    container classes.
  - Rewrote the ObjectPool class to do its object allocations
    in 8 kilobyte "slabs" rather than one at a time.
    This cuts down on the number of calls to new/delete
    by an order of magnitude.
  - Added a -DMUSCLE_POOL_SLAB_SIZE build option in case
    you want the ObjectPools to use a different slab size.
    This value is specified in bytes.
  - Added an ExitWithoutCleanup() function to
    MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}, which is equivalent to
    _exit().  This wrapper function exists because I
    suspect _exit() may not be entirely portable.
  - Added a "testpool" program to the tests folder to
    measure the relative efficiency of various
    object-allocation techniques.
  - AbstractReflectSession::GetSessionIDString() now returns
    a (const String &) instead of a (const char *).
  - Added a GetSessionID() accessor to AbstractReflectSession.
  - Added a CreateDefaultSocket() method to the
    AbstractReflectSession class.  This method is called
    when AddNewSession() is passed a null SocketRef, and
    if implemented to return a non-NULL SocketRef, can be
    used to provide a default socket for the session.
  - Added a StdinDataIO class that can be used to do
    non-blocking-I/O on stdin without breaking the
    blocking-I/O functionality of stdout.
  o Renamed the SocketHolderRef class to Socket.
  o Added the a SocketRef class (which subclasses Ref<Socket>)
  o All MUSCLE functions that previously dealt with sockets
    as integer file descriptors now use the new SocketRef
    type instead.  This way there is no chance of leaking or
    double-freeing allocated sockets.
  o Removed the CloseSocket() function from the API, since
    it is no longer necessary.
  * Changed the static casts in StorageReflectSession.cpp
    to dynamic_cast<>, so that ReflectServers holding some
    sessions derived from StorageReflectSession and some
    derived directly from AbstractReflectSession will now
    work without crashing.
  o Removed GetDataIORef() and GetGatewayRef(), and changed
    GetDataIO() and GetGateway() to return references to Ref
    objects instead of pointers to objects.
  o AbstractReflectSession::CreateDataIO() now takes a
    (const SocketRef &) argument instead of an int, and now
    returns a DataIORef instead of a (DataIO *)
  o AbstractReflectSession::CreateGateway() now returns an
    AbstractMessageIOGatewayRef instead of a
    (AbstractMessageIOGateway *)
  o ReflectSessionFactory::CreateSession() now returns an
    AbstractReflectSessionRef instead of a (AbstractReflectSession *)
  o StorageReflectSession::GetNewDataNode() now returns a
    DataNodeRef instead of a (DataNode *).  This way any
    chance of a memory leak is avoided.
  o StorageReflectSession::ReleaseDataNode() has been
    removed since it is no longer necessary.
  o RefCountable's copy constructor no longer copies the
    _manager pointer, since items allocated in one ObjectPool
    can no longer be freed by a different ObjectPool.
  o MessageTransceiverThread::CreateSupervisorSession() now
    returns a ThreadSupervisorSessionRef instead of a
    (ThreadSupervisorSession *)
  o MessageTransceiverThread::CreateDefaultWorkerSession()
    now returns a ThreadWorkerSessionRef instead of a
    (AbstractReflectSession *)
  o MessageTransceiverThread::CreateDefaultSessionFactory()
    now returns a ThreadWorkerSessionFactoryRef() instead of
    a (ReflectSessionFactory *).
  o ThreadWorkerSessionFactory::CreateThreadWorkerSession()
    now returns a ThreadWorkerSessionRef instead of a
    (AbstractReflectSessionRef *).
  o The MessageTransceiverThread::AddNew*Session() family
    of methods now take a (const ThreadWorkerSessionRef &)
    argument instead of (const AbstractReflectSessionRef &).
  o The MessageTransceiverThread::PutAcceptFactory() family
    of methods now take a ThreadWorkerSessionFactoryRef
    argument instead of a ReflectSessionFactory.
  o MessageTransceiverThread::CreateReflectServer() now
    returns a ReflectServerRef instead of a (ReflectServer *).
  o The ReflectServer class now derives from RefCountable
    and has an associated ReflectServerRef typedef.
  o Removed the SetOkayToClose*() methods from the
    MessageTransceiverThread class, as they are no longer
    necessary.
  * BecomeDaemonProcess() now calls ExitWithoutCleanup()
    instead of exit(), to avoid crashing the parent process
    in the globals-cleanup phase (since the CompleteSetupSystem
    object destructor never gets a chance to run).
  * Replaced all calls to exit() with calls to
    ExitWithoutCleanup().
  * Tweaked FileDescriptorDataIO to compile correctly on
    64-bit systems.
  * Fixed typedefs of int32/uint32 for the PPC64 platform.
  * Fixed typedef of muscle_socklen_t on PPC64
  * ZipFileUtilityFunctions.cpp was calling newnothrow to
    allocate an array.  Changed it to call newnothrow_array
    instead.
  * RefCount::SetFromGeneric() would return B_NO_ERROR if
    you tried to call SetFromGeneric(NullRef()), but it
    wouldn't actually change the state of the Ref that
    you called it on.  It now sets the state to NULL in
    that case.
  * AtomicCounter.h now uses the public QAtomicInt API
    when compiled with Qt 4.4.0 or higher.  (When compiling
    with Qt 4.0.0 through 4.3.x, it will still use the old
    private atomic API)
  * Applied some tweaks to MuscleSupport.h for better
    MacOS/X Leopard compatibility.
  * Tweaked SharedMemory.h to compile on MacOS/X Leopard.

v3.40 Released 9/6/2007
  - Added experimental IPv6 support.  To use MUSCLE with
    IPv6, compile your code with the -DMUSCLE_USE_IPV6
    flag.  The new typedef ip_address will then be compiled
    as a 128-bit datatype (the new ip_address class) instead
    of being typedef'd to uint32.
  - Added a new PacketTunnelIOGateway class that is useful
    for "tunneling" arbitrarily large Messages over a
    packet-based protocol with a smaller maximum packet
    size (e.g. UDP).  The PacketTunnelIOGateway class
    will packetize large Messages and reconstruct them
    from the fragments at the other end.
  - Added SetAutoReconnectDelay() and GetAutoReconnectDelay()
    methods to the AbstractReflectSession class.  You can use
    these to easily configure your AbstractReflectSession to
    automatically reconnect itself after its connection to
    the server has been broken.
  - Added a new, optional (autoReconnectDelay) to all the
    AddNewConnectSession() methods in MessageTransceiverThread,
    QMessageTransceiverTherad, ServerComponent, and
    ReflectServer.  If specified, this argument will cause
    SetAutoReconnectDelay() to be called on the new session.
  - Added a new PacketizedDataIO class that can be used
    to "wrap" a streaming DataIO class (e.g.
    TCPSocketDataIO) and make it act more like a
    packet-style DataIO class (e.g. UDPSocketDataIO).
  - Accept() now has an optional second argument, which
    will return the IP address of the interface that
    a connection was accepted on.
  - Added a new IPAddressAndPort class which is handy
    for encapsulating an IP address and port number
    together in the same object.
  - PutAcceptFactory() and RemoveAcceptFactory() now
    accept optional local interface IP address arguments
    so that you can specify that connections to the
    server should only be accepted on a certain
    interface, if that's what you want.
  - PutAcceptFactory() now accepts an optional (retPort)
    argument which you can use to find out which port
    the factory was installed on.
  - PutAcceptFactory() now puts its connection-accepting
    socket into non-blocking mode so that the server
    can't ever block inside Accept().
  - Added a GetLocalInterface() method to the
    ReflectSessionFactory class so you can see which
    interface(s) that factory is associated with.
  - Added some more convenience methods to the Hashtable
    class: versions of GetNextKey(), PeekNextKey(),
    GetNextValue(), and PeekNextValue() that take
    a pointer-reference as their sole argument.
  - ReflectSessionFactory objects are now auto-assigned
    a globally unique ID number when they are created.
    This number can be accessed by calling
    ReflectSessionFactory::GetFactoryID().
  - Added a simple portscan utility (called "portscan")
    to the tests folder.
  - Added a GetChildProcessID() method to the
    ChildProcessDataIO class, which returns the child
    process's process ID (pid).
  - Added a ByteBufferDataIO class that lets you read/write
    ByteBuffer objects using the DataIO interface (as if
    they were files).
  - Added GetFirstFieldNameString() and GetLastFieldNameString()
    convenience methods to the Message class, so that
    you don't need to set up a MessageFieldNameIterator
    just to get a single field out of the Message.
  - Added a GetSourceOfLastReadPacket() method to the
    UDPSocketDataIO class, so that you can find out after a
    Read() call where the data you just read came from.
  - Added a SetSendDestination() method to the
    UDPSocketDataIO class, so that you can have Write()
    call sendto() instead of send() if you prefer.
  - Added a GetSendDestination() method to the
    UDPSocketDataIO class.
  - Added a testpacketio test to the tests folder, to
    unit-test the PacketizedDataIO class.
  - Added a testpackettunnel test to the tests folder,
    to unit-test the PacketTunnelIOGateway class.
  - Added a NestCount convenience class to the util
    folder.  This simple class handles some of the
    drudge work associated with tracking recursion
    levels of recursive function calls.
  - Added a Reposition() method to the Hashtable class
    that can be used to manually update the position
    of an auto-sorted-by-value entry that has been
    modified in-place.
  - Added MoveToTable() and CopyToTable() convenience
    methods to the Hashtable class.
  - Made some minor optimizations to the auto-sort-by-value
    code in the Hashtable class.
  o Removed the MemoryBufferDataIO class, since it
    was not very useful or well designed.
  o Changed the MessageTransceiverThread class's
    GetNextEventFromInternalThread() method so that
    it passes back the ReflectSessionFactory's ID
    (as a uint32) instead of its port number (as a
    uint16).  This was done because port numbers
    are no longer unique identifiers for session
    factories.
  o Changed the ReflectSessionFactory::CreateSession()
    method to take different arguments (note that this
    will break old code that defined its own
    ReflectSessionFactory subclasses!  That code will
    need to be updated to use the new arguments)
  o The NetworkInterfaceInfo class's GetName() and
    GetDescription() methods now return references to
    String objects, instead of character pointers.
  o Moved the declaration of Inet_NtoA() from
    MiscUtilityFunctions.h to NetworkUtilityFunctions.h.
  o Removed the GetLocalIPAddress() function from
    NetworkUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}, as it is redundant
    with (and less useful than) the new
    GetNetworkInterfaceInfos() function.
  o Removed the GetPort() method from the
    ReflectSessionFactory class, since factories are
    no longer necessarily associated with exactly
    one port number.
  * The final argument to the CreateAcceptingSocket()
    function in NetworkUtilityFunctions.h was documented
    incorrectly.  It lets you specify the IP address of
    a local interface, not a client's IP address.
  * The final argument to the SetPort() function in
    AcceptSocketsThread.h was documented incorrectly.
    It lets you specify the IP address of a local interface,
    not a client's IP address.
  * Fixed a bug in ReflectServer's ReflectSessionFactory
    design that caused muscled not to work correctly if
    you told it to listen to more than one port at once.
  * Added an #ifdef to NetworkUtilityFunctions.cpp so
    that it will compile cleanly on BeOS/R5.0.3
  * HashtableIterator::GetValue() was returning a const
    reference.  Changed it to return a non-const reference,
    since there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to
    modify the returned object.
  * Fixed a bug where calling PutAcceptFactory() with
    the port argument set to zero would cause all already
    attached accept-factories to be removed.
  * Fixed a minor bug in the ReflectServer event loop,
    where the fd_sets would be inspected after select()
    returned -1/EINTR.  This could cause spurious
    (albeit generally harmless) read-ready or
    write-ready events to be detected.
  * The assignment operator, equality operator,
    ContainsValue(), and the batch Put() and Remove()
    methods in the Hashtable class now specify the
    HTIT_FLAG_NOREGISTER flag in their HashtableIterator
    objects, for better thread safety.

v3.34 Released 7/12/2007
  - Optimized CreateConnectedSocketPair() by having it
    use the UNIX socketpair(AF_UNIX) function on systems
    that support that call.
  o Removed the optional (useNagles) argument from the
    CreateConnectedSocketPair() function, since there
    is little or no point in using Nagles algorithm
    for sockets within the same process.  (if you
    really needed it for some reason, you could still
    call SetSocketNaglesAlgorithmEnabled() manually on
    the resulting sockets afterwards)
  o tests/cvscopy.cpp is now tests/svncopy.cpp, since I
    don't use CVS anymore.
  * Thread::WaitForNextMessageAux() wasn't handling file
    descriptors properly when called with a wakeupTime
    less than or equal to the current time.  Fixed.
  o Added a testpulsenode.cpp file to the tests folder, to
    test the reliability and scalability of the PulseNode
    timed-event-callback implementation.
  * Fixed some valgrind hits in NetworkUtilityFunctions.cpp
    by having the code check the sin_family of sockaddr
    structs before reading any IPv4-specific fields.
  * QMuscleSupport.h wouldn't compile under Qt 3.x.  Fixed.
  * Added Mika Lindqvist's patches to get QMuscleSupport.h
    to compile under older versions of Microsoft Visual C++.
  * The SharedUsageLimitProxyMemoryAllocator class was not
    always freeing all of the cached memory during large free
    operations, which could result in the process-memory-cache
    getting too large.  Fixed.
  * Fixed a bug in the PulseNode class's linked list code
    that could cause PulseChildren to not have their Pulse()
    methods called at the proper times.
  * Merged in Bryan Varner's patch to the MessageTransceiverThread
    Java class so that spurious connect-succeeded tags are no longer
    sent by the I/O thread to the main thread.

v3.33 Released 6/6/2007
  - Added a MultiDataIO class, for convenient writing of
    mirrored files, etc.
  - Added a qtsupport/QMuscleSupport.h header file to
    contain Qt-specific utility/helper code.  Currently
    this file contains only a QString specialization of
    the HashFunctor template, to allow QStrings to be
    used as keys in a Hashtable.
  * SetupSystem.cpp builds again under BeOS (worked around
    BeOS's non-standard gmtime_r() call)
  * Merged in Lior Okman's patch to the Java client code
    to fix a bug where partially received Messages might
    get dropped, causing a TCP disconnect.
  * Added a loop around the Unix implementation of
    SharedMemory::AdjustSemaphore()'s call to semop(),
    so that if semop returns EINTR, the call is retried.

v3.32 Released 5/2/2007
  - Added a new class, SharedFilterSessionFactory, which looks
    at the contents of a shared memory region to decide which
    client IP address(es) to allow to connect to the server.
  - Added a IsIPAddress(const char *) convenience method
    to NetworkUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.  This method returns true
    iff its argument is a string representing an IP address
    in human-readable ASCII format.
  - Added a new function GetNetworkInterfaceInfos() to
    NetworkUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.  This function returns
    a list of NetworkInterfaceInfo objects describing the
    various network interfaces currently available on the
    host machine.
  - tests/testnetutil.cpp Now tests GetNetworkInterfaceInfos()
    by calling it and printing out the results.
  - Added a new argument (emitEndMessageBatchIfNecessary)
    to the QMessageTransceiverHandler::Reset() and
    QMessageTransceiverThread::UnregisterHandler() methods, so
    that if these methods are called while in the middle of a
    receiving-Messages batch, the un-registering of the handler
    will no longer cause an imbalance between the number of
    BeginMessageBatch() and EndMessageBatch() signals that
    get emitted by the handler.  (You can override this behavior
    by passing in false for the new argument)
  - The muscle/java/build.xml file now builds JavaDocs too.
  o AbstractReflectSession::GetHostName() now returns a
    (const String &) instead of a (const char *).
  * Fixed a bug in SharedMemory::DeleteArea() that was
    preventing the shared memory area's semaphore from
    being deleted.
  * Rewrote the linked-list handling code in the
    QMessageTransceiverThread class to use a doubly-linked-list.
    This fixes a bug where the previous singly-linked-list
    would occasionally not get updated properly, resulting
    in the failure to emit EndMessageBatch signals in some
    circumstances.
  * The GlobalMemoryAllocator class now calls AboutToFree()
    if AboutToAllocate() succeeded but malloc() or realloc()
    failed.  That way AboutToFree() can undo AboutToAllocate()'s
    side effects in the usual fashion.
  * The SharedUsageLimitProxyMemoryAllocator class would
    deduct a buffer's memory size from the tally twice in
    the event of a memory failure.  Fixed.
  * The SharedUsageLimitProxyMemoryAllocator class now detects
    when a program tries to reduce its memory usage counter to
    less than zero, and clamps the counter to zero instead of
    letting it wrap around to the 4 gigabyte range.
  * The GlobalMemoryAllocator class now calls SetAllocationHasFailed()
    on the MemoryAllocator object only if the second try to
    allocate memory has also failed.  That way, if the first try
    fails, but the MemoryAllocator's AllocationFailed() method
    is able to free up some space to make the second try succeed,
    program operation can proceed without any further disruption.
  * ProxyMemoryAllocator::AllocationFailed() no longer calls
    SetAllocationHasFailed(true) on its slave allocator.
    That call is to be made solely by
    ProxyMemoryAllocator::SetAllocationHasFailed(), instead.
  * AutoCleanupProxyMemoryAllocator::AllocationFailed() now
    calls up to its parent class as well as doing its regular
    OutOfMemory() callbacks.
  * Cleaned up the JavaDoc comments so that they now build
    without any warnings from the javadoc utility.
  * The POSIX implementation of GetCurrentTime64() wasn't
    handling Daylight Savings Time properly, which meant its
    result would be off by an hour for part of the year.  Fixed.
  * Changed some calls to gmtime() and localtime() to gmtime_r()
    and localtime_r() respectively, to make them thread-safe.

v3.31 Released 3/14/2007
  - The AtomicCounter API is now aware of Qt 4's atomic
    counter API, and will use that as its implementation in
    Qt-enabled programs compiled on systems where MUSCLE's
    own inline-assembly support isn't available.
  - hexterm will now send ASCII bytes if you prefix them
    with a slash (e.g. "/0 /1 /2" sends 0x30, 0x31, 0x32)
  - Added a Hashtable::IndexOfValue() function that lets you
    find the index of the first (or last) value of a given
    type in a Hashtable.  (with O(N) search time)
  - Added implementations of the GetByteBufferFromPool() and
    GetMessageFromPool() functions that take a user-specified
    ObjectPool instead of using a default object pool.
  - Added support for a new compiler flag, MUSCLE_64_BIT_PLATFORM,
    which can be defined in your Makefile if you are on a 64-bit
    platform that isn't autodetected inside of MuscleSupport.
  - Added INT32_FORMAT_SPEC and UINT32_FORMAT_SPEC macros so
    that printf() statements can be made less architecture-specific.
  - Added a section  to the tests/testtypdefs.cpp test that checks
    to make sure the *_FORMAT_SPEC macros are working correctly on
    the current platform.
  - DataNode::GetChildIterator() now takes an optional flags parameter
    that is passed on to the HashtableIterator constructor.
  - Added a DataNode::HasChildren() convenience method.
  o Made the String class's destructor inline.
  * SetupSystem.cpp wouldn't compile on 64-bit systems when
    using Mutexes to implement atomic operations.  Fixed.
  * Merged in Lior Okman's patch to the Java client code that
    sets the socket's send and receive buffers to 128KB.
  * Merged in Lior Okman's patch to the Java client code to
    fix an occasional busy-loop that could occur when
    receiving very large (>400KB) Message objects.
  * Merged in Nathan Whitehorn's patch to the FreeBSD
    #ifdef's in NetworkUtilityFunctions.cpp.
  * Fixed a bug in MemMem() that where an incorrect return
    value would be returned when both buffers were the same size.
  * Fixed a bug in RawQueryFilter::SetFromArchive() that could
    cause a crash.
  * Some of muscle's text output would be wrong on 64-bit
    platforms.  Fixed by changing all printf()'s to use the new
    INT32_FORMAT_SPEC and UINT32_FORMAT_SPEC macros when appropriate.
  * Fixed a bug in the Makefiles so that g++ now compiles all code
    with all warnings enabled (except the multi-char constants warning).
  * Went through the test files and fixed the minor problems that
    were causing them to generate compiler warnings with -Wall enabled.
  * hexterm now prints out an error message when it aborts due to
    an invalid return code from Read() or Write().

v3.30 Released 1/16/2007
  ***NOTE*** In this release, the byte-swapping functions for
  floating point and double-precision floating point operations
  have been renamed.  If your code handles floating-point byte
  swapping itself, you will need to update your code before it
  will compile.  See the FLOAT_TROUBLE and DOUBLE_TROUBLE comments
  in support/MuscleSupport.h for details about this issue.
  - Added a QMessageTransceiverHandler helper class to
    QMessageTransceiverThread.{cpp,h}.  This class handles the
    multiplexing and demultiplexing of multiple session objects inside
    a single QMessageTransceiverThread object, so that Qt-based programs
    that use a N:1 session-to-thread model will be easier to write
    and maintain.
  - Added a QMessageTransceiverThreadPool helper class to
    QMessageTransceiverThread.{cpp,h}.  This class manages the automatic
    creation of QMessageTransceiverThreads when QMessageTransceiverHandlers
    are set up, so that an N:1 session-to-thread model can be implemented
    automatically in Qt-based programs.
  - Rewrote hexterm's output routine to be more useful; it now outputs
    both ASCII and hex data, in a format similar to that used by od.
  - Added chatclient.cpp to the tests folder.  chatclient.cpp is a
    simple command-line BeShare compatible chat client (previously
    distributed separately as "Clyde")
  - Added a minichatclient.c to the tests folder.  minichatclient.c
    is a C-only implementation of chatclient.cpp, just to show how
    it can be done using only the MiniMessage and MiniMessageGateway APIs.
  - Added a MemMem() function to MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.  MemMem()
    is similar to strstr(), except that instead of operating on
    NUL-terminated strings, it operates on binary data.
  - Rewrote the PulseNode class to be more efficient when many children
    are present -- PulseNode now stores its children in ordered linked
    lists rather than in a Hashtable, and it no longer needs to iterate
    over all children in order to recalculate the next event time.
  - Merged in Lior Okman's enhancement to the Java API:
    StringBuffer is now used in toString() methods, instead of
    concatenating strings directly.
  - Merged in Lior Okman's enhancement to the Java API:
    Faster ByteBuffer operations are now used to fill in arrays,
    instead of looping over the arrays and manually setting the values.
  - Merged in Lior Okman's enhancement to the Java API:
    Use List instead of Vector and HashMap instead of HashTable.  This is
    to lose the extra unneeded synchronization point that exists in these
    old and deprecated (as of Java 1.2) classes.  Since ByteBuffer requires
    at least JDK 1.4 anyway, there is no need to use the older API.
  - Merged in Lior Okman's enhancement to the Java API:
    Use Iterator instead of Enumeration - same reason as above.
    Note that this change will break compatibility with old Java
    code that calls Message.fieldNames() -- it will need to be
    updated to use an Iterator instead of an Enumeration.
  - Merged in Lior Okman's enhancement to the Java API:
    Changed the implementation of Queue.removeAllElements() to a
    more efficient implementation.
  - Merged in Lior Okman's enhancement to the Java API:
    Modified the ThreadPool to use a ThreadGroup and provide thread names.
    This makes the class more profiler-friendly.
  - Merged in Lior Okman's enhancement to the Java API:
    Message.flatten() is faster now, because it doesn't call
    flattenedSize() as much anymore.
  - Merged in Lior Okman's patch that adds a setOutgoingEncoding()
    method to the Java IOGateway classes, so that you can change
    message encodings on the fly.
  - Made the IOGateway _outgoingEncoding variable private:
    use setOutgoingEncoding() and getOutgoingEncoding() to access it.
  - Merged in Nathan Whitehorn's patch to make FinalizeAsyncConnect()
    work properly under FreeBSD 7.
  - Merged in Nathan Whitehorn's patch to fix a bug in SSLSocketDataIO
    (previously, it could sometimes error out if the message length
    exceeded the network's MTU)
  - Rewrote the B_SWAP_* macros as C-compatible inline functions
    (previously they called the muscleSwapBytes() template function,
    which made them unusable in C programs)
  - Added the new replacement floating-point byte-swap API to
    support/MuscleSupport.h, including the following new functions:
      B_HOST_TO_BENDIAN_IFLOAT    B_BENDIAN_TO_HOST_IFLOAT
      B_HOST_TO_LENDIAN_IFLOAT    B_LENDIAN_TO_HOST_IFLOAT
      B_HOST_TO_BENDIAN_IDOUBLE   B_BENDIAN_TO_HOST_IDOUBLE
      B_HOST_TO_LENDIAN_IDOUBLE   B_LENDIAN_TO_HOST_IDOUBLE
  - Added a -DMUSCLE_AVOID_INLINE_ASSEMBLY flag that you can set if
    you want to avoid the use of inline assembly for some reason.
  - Changed the ConvertFromNetworkByteOrder() and ConvertToNetworkByteOrder()
    private virtual methods in the Message::PrimitiveDataTypeArray private
    class by changing them to operate on N items at once, instead of having
    to be called repeatedly for each item in an array.
  - PointerDataArray::ConvertFromNetworkByteOrder() and
    ConvertToNetworkByteOrder() now cause an assertion failure if called
    (because they should never be called: pointers aren't serializable)
  - Added a set of common comparison functions (Int8CompareFunc,
    Int16CompareFunc, Int32CompareFunc, Uint8CompareFunc, etc)
    to MuscleSupport.h because I was tired of reimplementing them
    separately every time I needed to sort a Queue or a Hashtable.
  - support/MuscleSupport.h now defines a new preprocessor constant,
    SELECT_ON_FILE_DESCRIPTORS_NOT_AVAILABLE, when compiled on an OS
    that doesn't know how to select on file descriptor (e.g. stdin).
    Currently that includes Win32 and BeOS.
  o Removed the GetChildren() and GetPulseChildrenIterator() methods
    from the PulseNode class, since they are no longer applicable.
  o Separated the single-argument Hashtable and Queue constructors into
    two separate constructors:  a zero-argument default constructor, and
    a single-item constructor tagged "explicit".  That way nonsensical
    conversions (e.g. myHashtable.Put(5)) get caught at compile-time
    rather than becoming hard-to-discover run-time errors.
  o Rewrote muscleSwapBytes() to use a union instead of pointer-magic.
  o The Java IOGateway classes are once again declared public instead
    of being package-private -- that way you don't have to use the
    MessageIOGatewayFactory class if you don't want to.
  o MakePrettyTypeCodeString() is now implemented as an inline function
    instead of a preprocessor macro.
  * Merged in Lior Okman's fix for the flattenMessage() methods
    in the MessageIOGateway classes, to make them work reliably
    with non-blocking sockets.
  * Fixed a bug in MessageTransceiverThread.cpp that would cause
    many of the commands sent to the internal thread to be received
    by all of the internal thread's sessions instead of just the
    intended target.
  * Fixed some bugs in testendian.cpp, and made its output prettier
    and more informative.
  * Removed the following functions from MuscleSupport.h:
       B_SWAP_FLOAT               B_SWAP_DOUBLE
       B_HOST_TO_LENDIAN_FLOAT    B_HOST_TO_BENDIAN_FLOAT
       B_HOST_TO_LENDIAN_DOUBLE   B_HOST_TO_BENDIAN_DOUBLE
       B_LENDIAN_TO_HOST_FLOAT    B_BENDIAN_TO_HOST_FLOAT
       B_LENDIAN_TO_HOST_DOUBLE   B_BENDIAN_TO_HOST_DOUBLE
    Because they cannot be made to work reliably on x86-architecture
    chips.  (See the FLOAT_TROUBLE and DOUBLE_TROUBLE comments in
    support/MuscleSupport.h for details)
  * Message.py's unit test now correctly reads and writes its file
    in binary mode.  Thanks to David Rene for reporting this bug.

v3.24 Released 11/28/2006
  - The MacOS/X implementation of GetRunTime64() is now implemented
    using the CoreServices UpTime() function instead of POSIX times(),
    which makes it more efficient, allows it to return more accurate
    values, and avoids some potential problems with wrapping.
  - Added GetKey() and GetValue() convenience methods to the
    HashtableIterator class.
  - Added -- and ++ operators to the HashtableIterator class.
  - Added SetBackwards() and IsBackwards() methods to the
    HashtableIterator class.
  - Added a GetFlags() method to HashtableIterator class.
  - Added a new MessageFieldNameIterator constructor that takes
    a Message object.  This is more efficient than calling
    msg.GetFieldNameIterator() and requires less typing.
  - Added ++ and -- operators to the MessageFieldNameIterator class.
  - Added a GetFieldName() method to the MessageFieldNameIterator class.
  - Each DataNode object now keeps a running maximum of the IDs in
    the child nodes that are attached to it.  You can access this
    running maximum via the new GetMaxKnownChildIDHint() method.
    This value can be useful when generating a unique name for
    a new child node.
  - Also added a SetMaxKnownChildIDHint() method to the DataNode
    class.  This lets you manually reset the hint if you need to.
  - Updated tests/testhashtable.cpp so that it now tests for the
    HashtableIterator bug described below.
  - The MessageReplaceFunc callback used by CloneDataNodeSubtree()
    now takes a node-path as its first argument, in addition to the
    other arguments it took before.
  - The Python error strings generated by the ConvertMessageToPyObject()
    in PythonUtilityFunctions.cpp are now a bit more informative (they
    contain the problematic field name and/or type code)
  o Reduced the default output-stall timeout from 20 minutes
    to 3 minutes.
  o Removed the () operator from the MessageFieldNameIterator class
    because it was inconsistent with the operators of other iterator
    classes, and rarely (never?) used anyway.
  o Updated the copyright notices to 2007 Meyer Sound Laboratories Inc
    (a.k.a. the new owners of what was Level Control Systems)
  * The output-stall-detector mechanism would not disconnect
    moribund clients in a timely manner if the server was
    completely idle.  Now it does.
  * Fixed a subtle bug in the HashtableIterator class that could
    cause the iterator to skip past the 2nd item in a traversal
    if the 1st item in the traversal was deleted at the wrong time.
  * Updated the portablereflectclient.cpp and portableplaintextclient.cpp
    example programs to include a hack-around for Win32's inability
    to select() on stdin.

v3.23 Released 9/15/2006
  - Added Nathan Whitehorn's SSLSocketDataIO class to the dataio
    subfolder.  This class can be used to layer MUSCLE traffic over
    an SSL connection.  Thanks Nathan!  Note that this code requires
    the OpenSSL developer's toolkit to be installed before it will
    compile.
  - Enhanced the ParseArgs() routine to handle spaces intelligently
    (e.g. "x = 5" is now equivalent to declaring a key "x" with value
    "5", not declaring three separate variables named "x", "=", and "5")
  - Added Put() and Remove() methods to the Hashtable class that
    can put or remove the contents of an entire Hashtable at once.
  - Added NybbleizeString() and DenybblizeString() convenience functions
    to the MiscUtilityFunctions API.
  - Added a MUSCLE_USE_QUERYPERFORMANCEHARDWARE compile-time flag that
    tells MUSCLE to use QueryPerformanceCounter() under Windows instead
    of timeGetTime().  Specifying this flag improves GetRunTime64()'s
    accuracy, but QueryPerformanceCounter() is known to have problems on
    certain PC systems.
  * Fixed the Win32 and POSIX implementations of GetRunTime64() so that
    when the underlying OS clock "wraps" around to zero, it is detected
    and transparently handled so that the values returned by GetRunTime64()
    continue to increase monotonically.
  * Fixed the vc++/muscle.dsp project file so that things link properly
    again (thanks to Maurizio for help with this)
  * Added several tweaks to compile properly under MS Visual Studio 2005.
  * Made sure the files in the vc++ subfolder have Windows line endings.
  * Fixed a couple of bugs in the String class -- empty strings that
    had extra space preallocated in them could end up with unitialized
    garbage in them.
  * MuscleSupport.h now #defines WIN32 if _MSC_VER is defined.
  * Updated the QMessageTransceiverThread and QAcceptSocketThread
    classes further, so that they compile under Qt4 even when Qt3
    compatibility support is disabled.
  * Fixed a problem under Win32, where GetSystemPath() would return an
    incorrectly formed path when unicode characters were present in the
    path name.

v3.22 Released 7/5/2006
  - Updated the Mutex, Thread, and QMessageTransceiverThread classes so
    that they are compatible with both Qt3 and Qt4.
  - Added a Python implementation of the zlib/ZLibUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}
    API.  It is in python/ZLibUtilityFunctions.py
  * Fixed a valgrind hit in the Linux implementation of GetSystemPath()
  * Commented out the buggy-QueryPerformanceCounter() warning under Win32,
    since it usually causes more confusion than enlightenment when it
    is printed.
  * Changed the custom-event codes in QMessageTransceiverThread.cpp
    and QAcceptSocketsThread.cpp to be in the allowed range for user-codes.
  * Added Lior Okman and Rony Gutherz' patches to re-enable compilation
    on 64-bit systems, Solaris, MSVC, and Windows 2000.
  * Added Mika Lindqvist's patch to allow use of the newnothrow macro
    under VC++6.
  * Updated the Makefile in the borland subdirectory to compile correctly.

v3.21 Released 5/27/2006
  - Added SYSTEM_PATH_USERHOME, SYSTEM_PATH_DESKTOP, and
    SYSTEM_PATH_DOCUMENTS, and SYSTEM_PATH_ROOT to the list
    of directories returnable by GetSystemPath().
  - GetHostByName() now requires a second argument, (expandLocalhost),
    which determines whether 127.0.0.1 should be returned verbatim, or
    expanded out to the primary local IP address.
  - Added an (expandLocalhost) argument to the various AddNewConnectSession()
    methods that take a string for a hostname argument.
  - Added an (expandLocalhost) argument to the GetPeerIPAddress() function.
  - Added a RemoveEscapeChars() utility function to StringMatcher.{cpp,h}
  - Rewrote GetLocalIPAddress() to use the if_nameindex() API if it
    is available.  If not, it will fall back to the old method of using
    gethostname().
  - StorageReflectSession::SaveNodeTreeToMessage() and
    StorageReflectSession::RestoreNodeTreeFromMessage() now both take
    an optional (maxDepth) argument which can be used to specify the
    maximum depth of the node-subtree to be saved or restored.
  - The PR_COMMAND_GETDATATREES Message now has an optional PR_NAME_MAXDEPTH
    int32 field:  If specified, the returned data trees will be clipped to
    the specified maximum depth
  - Added a PutAndGet() convenience method to the Hashtable class.
    This method puts a new object into the Hashtable, and returns a pointer
    to the object in the table.

v3.20 Released 3/20/2006
  - Added SetGlobalQueryFilterFactory() and GetGlobalQueryFilterFactory()
    calls, so that it is possible for MUSCLE-based servers to install
    their own custom QueryFilterFactory objects if desired.
  o Moved the DataNode class out into its own file, DataNode.{cpp,h}.
    It is no longer an inner class of the StorageReflectSession class.
  o All QueryFilter::Matches() methods now take a DataNode pointer
    as their second argument.  None of the built-in QueryFilter subclasses
    use this value, but it is available so that custom QueryFilters can
    use DataNode information in their matching decisions if necessary.
  o Renamed InstantiateQueryFilter() to CreateQueryFilter(), and
    made it a virtual method in the new QueryFilterFactory class,
    instead of a global function.
  * Added serialization to muscleAlloc()/muscleRealloc()/muscleFree(),
    to avoid potential race conditions in multithreaded programs that
    have memory-usage-tracking enabled.
  * Fixed a bug in the Java receive code that could cause a
    parse error and subsequent disconnect if the Message stream
    was uncompressed (DEFAULT_MESSAGE_ENCODING) and a large
    Message was followed by a small one.
  * Fixed a typo in the java/build.xml file.
  * Rewrote MusclePowerPCSwapDouble() and MuscleX86SwapDouble()
    to use unions instead of C-style casting.  Doing it this way
    makes them more readable and avoids errors due to uncontrolled
    interactions with g++'s optimizer.
  * Made the testendian test program a little more robust.

v3.11 Released 3/1/2006
  - Added a testsysteminfo.cpp test to the test folder, to test
    the functions in the SystemInfo.{cpp,h} files.
  - Merged in Lior Okman's updates to the muscle Java classes so that
    they now support the new, more efficient java.nio.* interfaces.
    Note that this means that the Java API now requires Java 1.4.0
    or higher; let me know if that is a problem for you.
  - Added zlib/ZipFileUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}, which contain functions
    that create a .zip file from a MUSCLE Message, and vice versa.
    Also added a testzip.cpp program to the test folder to test them.
  - Added a more convenient Inet_NtoA(uint32) function (that returns
    a String) to MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}
  o Optimized TCPSocketDataIO::FlushOutput() slightly under Linux.
  * Merged in Lior Okman's AMD-64 compatibility patch.
  * Patched NetworkUtilityFunctions.cpp to handle net_length_t
    properly under *BSD.

v3.10 Released 1/16/2006
  - Added the JCraft JZLib code to the included Java code tree, so that
    the MUSCLE Java code can again be compiled as provided.
  - Added a hashCode() method to the Java com.lcs.muscle.support.Point class.
  - Added NybbleizeData() and DenybbleizeData() convenience functions
    to MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.
  - Added GetFirstKey(), GetFirstValue(), GetLastKey(), and GetLastValue()
    utility methods to the Hashtable class.
  - Added a HTIT_FLAG_NOREGISTER flag to the HashtableIterator class
    that (when specified) will prevent the HashtableIterator from registering
    itself with the Hashtable.  This option allows you to do a 100%
    thread-safe Hashtable iteration, at the expense of requiring you to
    guarantee that the Hashtable won't be modified during the traversal.
  - Added a HasItems() convenience method to the Queue and Hashtable classes.
    This method returns true iff there is at least one item present in
    the object (i.e. it is the logical negation of the IsEmpty() method)
  - Added a HasNames() convenience method to the Message class.  This method
    returns true if the Message contains any fields.
  o Removed the Flattenable::CopyToImplementation() methods since they were
    redundant.  Instead, CopyTo() just calls CopyFromImplementation() with
    the arguments reversed.
  o Replaced the boolean (backwards) argument for HashtableIterators with a
    uint32 (flags) argument.  Currently supported flags are
    HTIT_FLAG_BACKWARDS (same as backwards=true in older versions) and
    the new HTIT_FLAG_NOREGISTER (see above for details)
  o Inlined some trivial one-liner methods in the Message class, for efficiency.
  * Merged in Eli "Scanty" Dayan's portability fixes so that the
    code again compiles properly under Solaris.  Thanks Scanty!
  * const methods in the Message class are now properly thread-safe
    (provided the Message object isn't altered by any other threads
    during their execution), thanks to the use of the
    HTIT_FLAG_NOREGISTER flag.
  * The math used in the MUSCLE_POWERPC_TIMEBASE_HZ implementation of
    GetRunTime64() would overflow after a week or two of uptime,
    causing GetRunTime64() to return incorrect results.  Fixed.
  * PythonUtilityFunctions.cpp now compiles correctly under MacOS/X Tiger.
  * Tweaked MuscleSupport.h so that MacOS/X will properly use the
    x86 assembly language functions when running on an Intel-based system.

v3.03 Released 10/10/2005
  - Added a GetLocalIPAddress() function to NetworkUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.
    This function returns the IP address(es) of the machine it is running on.
  - Refactored the ThreadWorkerSessionFactory::CreateSession() method out
    into two methods:  CreateSession() and CreateThreadWorkerSession().  That
    way subclasses can override CreateThreadWorkerSession() but still take
    advantage of the session-accepted-notification functionality present
    in CreateSession().
  - MessageTransceiverThread now identifies sessions via their root node
    path instead of just their session ID. (e.g. "/192.168.0.5/17", not "17")
  - Added David Grossman's -DMUSCLE_PREFER_QT_OVER_WIN32 patch, so that you
    can choose at compile time whether Muscle should prefer to use Win32 or
    Qt APIs for its threading/synchronization mechanisms.
  - Added the 'cvscopy' utility program to the test folder.
  * GetPeerIPAddress() and GetHostByName() now call GetLocalIPAddress() if
    necessary to determine the local IP address, rather than returning
    127.0.0.1.
  * GetSystemPath(SYSTEM_PATH_EXECUTABLE) would break under MacOS/X if
    the executable path contained any non-ASCII characters.  Fixed.
  * GetSystemPath() was broken under Win32 if Unicode support was
    enabled.  Fixed.
  * hexterm now compiles properly under MacOS/X.

v3.02 Released 9/10/2005
  - The second argument to Hashtable::GetOrPut() is now optional.
  - Merged in Lior Okman's changes to the Java client API:  these
    included several bug fixes and the added ability to send
    compressed Messages.  (If you have JZLib in your class path,
    you can receive compressed Messages also)
  - Added Lior's build.xml file for ant-based compilation and
    JAR-packaging of the muscle java API (into the java folder)
  - Added FailoverDataIO.{cpp,h} to the support folder.  FailoverDataIO
    is a class that supports automatic failover across multiple redundant
    DataIO streams.
  - Connect() now takes an optional timeout argument, for people
    who are too impatient to wait for the operating system's standard
    TCP connect timeout period to elapse.
  - The ParseFile() function in MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h} now supports
    hierarchical sub-sections (delimited in the text file with "begin foo"
    and "end" tag lines).
  - Added testparsefile.cpp to the test folder.
  o Moved the implementations of Inet_AtoN(), Inet_NtoA(),
    SetLocalHostIPOverride() and GetLocalHostIPOverride() from
    NetworkUtilityFunctions.cpp to SetupSystem.cpp, so that projects
    can include MiscUtilityFunctions.cpp without having to also
    include NetworkUtilityFunctions.cpp
  o Removed the MUSCLE_USE_CLONE support from the Thread class, since it
    didn't work properly anyway.
  * The Win32 implementation of the Thread class would leak a thread handle
    each time the internal Thread terminated.  Thanks to Eivind Midtg√•rd
    and Raymond Dahlberg for providing the fix!

v3.01 Released 8/13/2005
  - Added a "shared" parameter to the BindUDPSocket() function,
    to support the simultaneous reception of broadcast UDP packets
    by multiple processes on a single computer.
  - Updated the included zlib distribution to v1.2.3
  - Updated the hexterm app to handle UDP packet I/O (in addition
    to the TCP stream and serial device data I/O it could do before)
  - Added equality (==) and inequality (!=) operators to the Hashtable class.
  * GetSystemPath(SYSTEM_PATH_EXECUTABLE) now returns the proper
    path under Linux (it uses the /proc filesystem to figure it out)
  * ChildProcessDataIO now uses the constants found in sys/ttydefaults.h
    to fill in the termios struct, instead of using hard coded magic numbers.

v3.00 Released 7/12/2005
  NOTE:  THIS RELEASE BREAKS SOURCE CODE COMPATIBILITY WITH PREVIOUS
  RELEASES OF THE MUSCLE API.  IF YOU HAVE CODE THAT WAS WRITTEN FOR
  PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF  MUSCLE, YOU WILL NEED TO MODIFY IT SOMEWHAT
  IN ORDER FOR IT TO COMPILE AND RUN PROPERLY.  SEE THE TWO ITEMS
  MARKED WITH (o) BELOW FOR DETAILS.
  - Added Matt Emson's client API for Delphi, in the "delphi"
    subdirectory.  Thanks, Matt!
  - Updated the included zlib distribution to v1.2.2.
  - Added StoreTraceValue(), TCHECKPOINT(), SetTraceValuesLocation(),
    and associated functions to MuscleSupport.h.  These functions can
    be useful in tracking down where code is executing at when a
    debugger isn't available.
  - Added a maxDepth argument to the LogStackTrace() call.
  - Added a PrintStackTrace() function to syslog/SysLog.{cpp,h}.
    This is similar to LogStackTrace(), but the stack trace
    goes directly to stdout instead of going to the log facility.
  - Added a "win32client" test/example app to the test folder.
    This app test/demos the Win32MessageTransceiverThread class.
    A VC++ project file (win32client.vcproj) is also included.
  - Added a SetSignalHandlingEnabled() method to the ReflectServer
    class, to allow servers to exit cleanly when an interrupt
    signal is received.
  - muscled now accepts an optional "catchsignals" argument that
    enables handling of interrupt signals (Control-C) to initiate
    a controlled shutdown.
  - muscleMax() and muscleMin() can now take up to five arguments,
    for convenience.
  - If you define the compiler constant MUSCLE_ENABLE_MEMORY_PARANOIA
    to an integer value (and also define MUSCLE_ENABLE_MEMORY_TRACKING),
    then the muscle memory allocator/deallocator code will add that many
    guard values to the front and end of all dynamically allocated
    buffers in order to detect bad memory writes.  The guard values will
    be checked whenever the buffers are freed or resized, to make sure
    they haven't been overwritten, and it will also fill all allocated
    and freed buffers with special garbage bytes (0x55 and 0x66),
    so that it will be more obvious when freed or uninitialized
    memory is read.  This slows down execution a bit and uses up
    extra memory, so it should only be enabled while debugging.
  - Added a MemoryParanoiaCheckBuffer() function to
    GlobalMemoryAllocator.{cpp,h}.  Call this function to manually
    validate that an allocated memory buffer hasn't been corrupted.
  - All AbstractObjectRecycler objects (i.e. all ObjectPools)
    now register themselves in a global linked list, so that
    they can be iterated over.
  - Added the function GlobalFlushAllCachedObjects() to the
    AbstractObjectRecycler class.
  - Added a FlushCachedObjects() virtual method  to the
    AbstractObjectRecycler class.  This method is implemented
    in the ObjectPool subclasses to call Drain().
  - The CompleteSetupSystem destructor now calls
    AbstractObjectRecycler::GlobalFlushAllCachedObjects(), so
    that all the ObjectPools get flushed before any static objects
    start getting destroyed.  This helps avoid dangling pointer
    problems caused by the undefined ordering of static object
    destructor calls.
  - Added GetCount() and SetCount() methods to the AtomicCounter
    class, since it's occasionally necessary (albeit discouraged)
    to get or set the counter's value explicitly.
  - Added IsRefPrivate() and EnsureRefIsPrivate() methods to
    the Ref class to help facilitate Copy-on-Write semantics.
  - Added a FlushInput() method to the PlainTextMessageIOGateway class.
  - Added a BUILDOPTIONS.txt file to the muscle folder, to document
    the various compile-time flags that muscle uses.
  - Added WriteFully() and ReadFully() convenience methods to
    the DataIO class.  These methods call Write() or Read()
    in a loop as necessary to guarantee that the whole buffer
    get written.
  - Added new convenience methods FlattenToByteBuffer(),
    UnflattenFromByteBuffer(), FlattenToDataIO() and
    UnflattenFromDataIO() to the Flattenable class, so that you
    can now Flatten()/Unflatten() to/from ByteBuffers and
    DataIOs with a single call when using blocking I/O.
  - Added a GetLength() convenience function to the Flattenable
    class, for easy determination of a DataIO's length in bytes.
  - Rewrote InflateMessage() and DeflateMessage() so that they
    spend less time holding the global muscle lock.
  o Changed all Ref arguments to be passed by const reference
    instead of by value.  Note that this change will break most
    current Muscle-using source code -- your source code will
    need to be changed to match, in order for the virtual methods
    to be overridden properly.  To update your code, you should
    change all function arguments of type BlahRef to (const BlahRef &).
  o Moved the AbstractObjectRecycler pointer out of the Ref class
    and into the RefCountable class, and changed it into an
    AbstractObjectManager pointer.  Removed the recycler
    argument from all Ref class methods.  This makes the
    Ref class a bit simpler and more efficient, but it also
    breaks existing source code.  To update your code, you
    should change all instances of BlahRef(blah, NULL) to
    BlahRef(blah), and all instances of BlahRef(blah, NULL, false)
    to BlahRef(blah, false).
  o Replaced StorageReflectSession::DrainPools() with
    AbstractObjectRecycler::GlobalFlushAllCachedObjects(),
    which does the same thing but more thoroughly, since
    it flushes all ObjectPools and not just a few of them.
  o Moved a few overly large inline convenience functions into
    SetupSystem.cpp, for faster compilation and smaller binaries.
  o InflateMessage() now guarantees that the inflated Message
    will have the same 'what' code as the passed-in Message
    (the what code of the 'interior' Message is ignored).
  * Added a newnothrow_array #define to MuscleSupport.h and
    changed all the muscle code to use it instead of
    newnothrow when allocating arrays.  This macro works
    the same as new (nothrow) for arrays, except it works
    around a bug in gcc 3.x that could cause crashes on
    memory failure.
  * ChildProcessDataIO now forces the removal if the SIGHUP
    signal handler in the child process, so that any
    grandchild processes will be cleaned up when the child
    process is killed.
  * Improved ChildProcessDataIO handling of restricted
    permissions on the /dev/tty* nodes.
  * Under Win32, if there were no sockets to select() on, select()
    would error out and the server loop would return.  Fixed.
  * Log() and LogTime() could forget to unlock the global
    muscle lock if called re-entrantly.  Fixed.
  * Fixed a nasty bug in the MUSCLE_POWERPC_TIMEBASE_HZ inline
    assembly implementation of GetRunTime64() that would cause
    GetRunTime64() to very occasionally go into an infinite loop.

v2.65 Released 5/20/2005
  - Optimized the String class by providing overloaded
    implementations of various common methods that take a
    (const char *) directly, rather than a (const String &).
    This eliminates much of the need for the compiler to
    construct and destroy temporary String objects when
    using string literals.
  - Added StartsWith() and EndsWith() convenience methods
    to the Queue class.
  o Made about a dozen one-liner String methods into into
    inline methods, to reduce CPU overhead in calling them.
  * Fixed a bug in the Windows implementation of
    ChildProcessDataIO that would cause the child process
    to be killed the first time it generated any text to stdout.
  * Fixed a problem in GetHumanReadableTimeValues() when
    compiling under Windows with pre-WinXP headers.  Thanks
    to Mika Lindqvist for helping with this fix.
  * Added an #ifdef for _SOCKLEN_T to NetworkUtilityFunctions.cpp,
    so that net_length_t will be typedef'd properly on systems
    that need it.

v2.64 Released 4/20/2005
  - ConvertMessageItemToPyObject() now handles restoring list
    objects and dictionary objects.
  - testendian.cpp now does a bit more thorough job of testing
    the correctness of the byte swapping routines
  - Merged in Mika Lindqvist's patch to add inline-assembly
    implementations of the byte-swapping and atomic counter
    functions for the Win32/Visual C++ build environment.
  - Added Equals(char), EqualsIgnoreCase(char), EndsWith(char),
    EndsWithIgnoreCase(char), StartsWith(char), and
    StartsWithIgnoreCase(char) methods to the String class.
  - Added an optional (maxResults) parameter to
    ServerComponent::FindMatchingSessions(), and added a
    ServerComponent::FindMatchingSession() convenience method.
  - MuscleSupport.h now looks for a MUSCLE_FD_SETSIZE compiler
    constant; if found, it will use that to force the host's
    FD_SETSIZE to a new value (particularly useful under
    Windows where FD_SETSIZE is a pitiful 64... just add
    -DMUSCLE_FD_SETSIZE=512 to make it more reasonable)
  - Added a SetFromGenericUnchecked() method to the Ref class,
    for fast/unsafe reference-type conversion.
  - Added testtime.cpp to the test folder, to test MUSCLE's
    time/date handling functions.
  - GetCurrentTime64(), GetHumanReadableTimeValues(),
    ParseHumanReadableTimeString(), and GetHumanReadableTimeString()
    now all take a timezone argument that indicates whether the uint64
    time value arguments are meant to represent local time or UTC.
    These parameters have default values that are set to preserve
    the previous behavior, for backward compatibility.
  o Moved QMessageTransceiverThread's event handling code
    out into a virtual separate method, called
    HandleQueuedIncomingEvents().
  o Removed "volatile" keyword from the assembly byte-swapping
    inline function implementations, since it is not necessary
    and impedes optimization.
  * Merged in David Grossman's Visual C++ compatibility changes.
  * Fixed several bugs in the String class where memcpy() was
    being called in situations where memmove() was necessary.

v2.63 Released 2/6/2005
  - muscled now accepts "port=0" as a command line argument.
    This argument will cause muscled to choose an available
    TCP port to listen for incoming messages on.
  - Added a GetHumanReadableTimeValues() function to
    MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.  It's similar to
    GetHumanReadableTimeString(), except the results
    are returned as separate integers rather than as a String.
  - Added an optional "muscleSingleThreadOnly" bool argument to the
    ThreadSetupSystem and CompleteSetupSystem constructors.  This
    flag lets you globally disable all Mutexes and other
    MUSCLE thread-safety mechanisms at run time.  Useful if you
    need to compile your app without the MUSCLE_SINGLE_THREAD_ONLY
    compiler flag, but know (sometimes) at runtime that you will
    be running the process single-threaded...
  - Added a ChildProcessReadyToRun() hook method to the
    ChildProcessDataIO class.  This method is called from inside
    the child process (except under Windows, which can't support it).
  - Added a GetSessionSelectSocket() convenience method to the
    AbstractReflectSession class.
  o ChildProcessDataIO now has a separate LaunchChildProcess()
    method, instead of launching the child process from inside
    the ChildProcessDataIO constructor.
  * Merged in Wilson Yeung's update to the C# client code --
    this update fixes an infinite-loop bug and makes flattening
    and unflattening of Message objects more efficient.
  * NetworkUtilityFunctions.cpp once again compiles under BeOS.
  * Incorporated Stephane Petithomme's patch to allow muscle
    to compile correctly under SunOS.
  * Merged in Monni's patches to GetSystemPath() so that it
    handles Windows Unicode paths correctly.
  * Replaced the Win32 implementation of GetCurrentTime64()
    with a more standard (read: accurate) implementation.
  * The Windows implementation of GetHumanReadableTimeValues()
    was not quite accurate.  Fixed.

v2.62 Released 1/1/2005
  - Added a SetUDPSocketBroadcastEnabled() function to the
    NetworkUtilityFunctions API.
  - Added a broadcastIP constant declaration to NetworkUtilityFunctions.h
  - Updated the "listener" test program to send hex bytes that are
    entered on stdin, to make outgoing TCP connections as well as
    accepting incoming ones, and to be able to connect to an
    RS232 serial port, if desired.  Renamed "listener" to "hexterm"
    to reflect its expanded functionality.
  - Added an AdoptBuffer() method to the ByteBuffer class, so that
    you can populate a ByteBuffer with a pre-existing array of bytes,
    if you are careful about memory-ownership issues..
  - Added a ChildProcessDataIO class, which is useful for spawning
    child processes and communicating with them interactively via
    their stdin/stdout streams.  Works under POSIX, Windows, OS/X, and BeOS.
  - Added a RemoveANSISequences() function to MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.
    This function strips all ANSI escape sequences from a given String.
  - Added a testchildprocess.cpp test to the test folder.  This
    program is used to make sure ChildProcessDataIO works correctly.
  - Added a system/SystemInfo.{cpp,h} support API.  These files contain
    a GetSystemPath() function (for locating various important directories
    on the host system), and a GetOSName() function that returns
    the name of the host operating system.
  o Adopted Jonas Sundstr√∂m' simplified Makefile for muscled.
  * Updated the dev-c++/muscled.dev file to properly build muscled.exe again.
  * The included Python scripts are updated to raise exceptions using
    proper Exception objects, rather than old-style bare-string exceptions.
  * pythonchat.py now handles exceptions properly.
  * SharedMemory regions are now created with full permissions (0777)
    instead of just permissions for user and group (0770).
  * Worked around a gcc inline-assembly bug in the PowerPC assembly
    implementation of GetRunTime64().  (this bug would cause GetRunTime64()
    to sometimes return the wrong value if the MUSCLE_POWERPC_TIMEBASE_HZ
    compiler constant was defined)
  * Added some BeOS-compatibility tweaks to the RS232DataIO class.
    (I haven't really tested them to see if they work properly though)

v2.61 Released 11/04/2004
  - Added a CPULoadMeter class to the util subfolder.  The CPULoadMeter
    class knows how to monitor the amount of CPU being used on your
    system.  Handy for doing xload style status displays.  Implemented
    for OS/X, Windows, and Linux only.
  - Added Jeff Koftinoff's Win32FileHandleDataIO class to the winsupport
    directory.
  - Added a "testtypedefs" test to the test folder.  You can run this
    program to check that the MUSCLE typedefs (int8, int16, int32, etc)
    are correctly defined for your build environment.
  - Added SetMaxPoolSize() and GetMaxPoolSize() methods to the
    ObjectPool class.
  - Added a handy utility named "listener" to the test folder.
    This simple program just listens on a specified port and prints
    out (in hexadecimal) the bytes it receives from any connecting
    TCP client.
  - Added PLOCK() and PUNLOCK() macros to Mutex.h, and a new utility
    called deadlockfinder.cpp to the test subfolder.  Together, these
    are useful for tracking down potential synchronization deadlocks in
    multithreaded programs.  See tests/deadlockfinder.cpp for details.
  * Added Peter Vorwerk's Tru64-compatibility patches.
  * Added Julien Torres' AMD64-compatibility patches.
  * Added an #ifdef to Thread.{cpp,h} so that the Thread class will
    compile properly with older (pre 3.2) versions of Qt.
  * Tweaked the code to again compile properly under BeOS/R5/PPC.
  * muscleFree now checks its argument for NULL-ness when memory
    tracking is disabled.

v2.60 Released 9/25/04
  - Added in the initial implementation of the MiniMessage code.
    MiniMessage is a minimalist C-only implementation of the Message
    dictionary class, for use with C programs or C++ programs where
    simplicity and low resource usage is more important than flexibility
    and convenience.  See the minimessage subfolder for details.
  - Added a Clear() method to the String class, for more efficient
    resetting of String objects.
  - Added a SetFromString() method to the String class, for more efficient
    copying of String objects.  Changed the copy constructor and
    assignment operator to call this method instead of SetCstr().
  - Added a constructor to the String class that takes a String and
    a maximum length in characters.
  - Added HashtableIterator constructors that take the Hashtable to
    iterate over as an argument, which is more convenient and efficient
    than calling table.GetIterator()
  - Rewrote the HashtableIterator construction code to be more efficient.
  - Added a compiler flag MUSCLE_AVOID_ASSERTIONS.  If you specify this
    flag in your Makefile, all MASSERT statements will become no-ops.
  - MuscleSupport.h is now parseable as a C header file (the C++ portions
    of this file will be #ifdef'd out when compiling as C).  The non-C++
    inline functions in this file are now declared as 'static inline'
    to avoid linker problems when compiling C programs.
  o muscled is now compiled with optimizations enabled by default.
    To turn optimization off, compile muscled using 'make debug' instead.
  * Merged in Monni's patch to make the INT64_FORMAT_SPEC, the
    UINT64_FORMAT_SPEC, and the MCRASH_IMPL macros work correctly under
    Visual C++ 6.0.
  * Calling Destroy() more than once on a Python MessageTransceiverThread
    object would cause an exception to be thrown.  Fixed.

v2.52 Released 8/13/04
  - Added a GetInternalQThreadPriority() hook to the Qt implementation
    of the Thread class.  This lets you specify the Thread priority
    of MUSCLE Threads launched from Qt programs, if you wish to.
  - Added a GetEmptyString() convenience function to the String class.
    This function returns a read-only reference to an empty string.
  * The Read() and Write() methods of the FileDescriptorDataIO class
    now return the correct values when used in blocking I/O mode.
  * Fixed a syntax error in Tuple::Replace() (thanks to Mika Lindqvist
    for bringing this to my attention).
  * Merged in Mika's patch to Message.cpp that fixes the template code
    so that it will compile without errors under gcc 3.4.1.
  * Rewrote the MuscleX86SwapInt64(), MuscleX86SwapDouble(),
    MusclePowerPCSwapInt64() and MusclePowerPCSwapDouble() inline
    assembly functions to work around problems with gcc's optimizer.
  * ParseArgs() now properly parses arguments with commas in them.
  * Integrated Wilson Yeung's fix for a race condition in the C# code.

v2.51 Released 6/27/04
  - Wilson Yeung contributed an alpha version of a C# port of the Java
    client code (included in the "csharp" subdirectory).  Thanks Wilson!
  - GetRunTime64() can now use the PowerPC time-base register,
    if running on a PowerPC CPU and you have #defined the compiler
    constant MUSCLE_POWERPC_TIMEBASE_HZ as the proper update rate.
  - Added SetMemoryAllocationStrategy() and GetMemoryAllocationStrategy()
    methods to the ByteBuffer class.  You can call these to specify an
    IMemoryAllocationStrategy object that the ByteBuffer will use to
    allocate and free its buffers, instead of calling muscleAlloc() and
    muscleFree().
  - The PlainTextMessageIOGateway class now has SetFlushPartialIncomingLines()
    and GetFlushPartialIncomingLines() methods, to govern whether "orphan"
    incoming text without a carriage return should be passed to the owner
    immediately, or whether it should be buffered until the carriage return
    is read.
  - Added in Monni's QNX compatibility patches.
  * Calling SetGateway() or SetDataIO() from within a ClientDisconnected()
    callback now does the right thing, instead of just immediately
    disconnecting the newly installed gateway (or DataIO) object afterwards.

v2.50 Released 6/01/04
  - If using gcc on a PowerPC or x86 target, inline assembly will be used
    in the B_SWAP_* byte swapping macros, which is more efficient than the
    traditional muscleSwapBytes() template function.
  * IsRegexToken() now also returns true when passed in any of the
    following characters: =^+${}:-
  * Removed the kludgy workaround from Mutex.h that simulated a recursive
    pthreads Mutex using an int counter, and replaced it with a proper
    PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE Mutex.  Note that the new code requires
    a UNIX98 compatible pthreads implementation -- under Linux, you
    may need to add -D_GNU_SOURCE to your Makefile in order to use this
    code.

v2.49 Released 5/07/04
  - The "daemon" keyword now takes an optional argument specifying
    where the daemon process's stdout and stderr should be redirected
    to.  If no argument is specified, /dev/null will be used by default.
  - Added support in the Thread class for a MUSCLE_USE_CLONE compile flag.
    If specified, this flag tells the Thread class to use Linux's clone()
    system call to create new threads, instead of the pthreads API.  If
    this flag is defined, the method Thread::SetCloneParameters() is
    available to specify the child thread's launch flags and stack size.
  - Added SwapContents() methods to the Message, ByteBuffer, and Ref classes.
  o StorageReflectSession methods SetDataNode(), RemoveDataNodes(), and
    InsertOrderedData() are now virtual.
  o The (createIfNecessary) argument to SpawnDaemonProcess() and
    BecomeDaemonProcess() now defaults to true.
  o ServerComponent::IsAttachedToServer() is now public.
  * ParseArgs() now handles comment # marks inside quotes properly.
  * Fixed a couple of Win32 incompatibilities.  Thanks to Monni
    for reporting these.
  * SysLog.cpp wouldn't compile under BeOS/PPC.  Fixed.
  * QMessageTransceiverThread::event() is now public and not a slot.
  * ByteBuffer::SetNumBytes() wasn't updating number-of-valid-bytes
    value correctly when called with retainData=true.  Fixed.

v2.48 - Released 3/17/04
  - Added a GetGroupSize() accessor method to the
    SharedUsageLimitProxyMemoryAllocator class.
  - Added ParsePort() and ParseConnectArg() convenience methods to the
    MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h} files.  These functions let you
    easily parse values out of "port" and "hostname:port" arguments.
  - Added an IsCallerInternalThread() method to the Thread class.
    This method returns true iff it's being called from the internal
    Thread itself, or false otherwise.
  - Added GetOwnerSocketSet() and GetInternalSocketSet() methods to
    the Thread class.  These let you customize the blocking behaviour
    of GetNextReplyFromInternalThread() and WaitForNextMessageFromOwner(),
    respectively.
  - Added a ParseArgs() method to MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.
    This method knows how to parse multiple arguments from a line of text.
  o The Thread class now prefers to use the Windows threading API
    over Qt threading when, both are available.
  * Connect() now logs an appropriate error message if a hostname
    lookup fails and logging is enabled.
  * Rewrote LogLineCallback::Log() to be more robust (it now calls
    vsnprintf() instead of vsprintf() and does proper bounds checking)
  * Fixed a problem with Message.py's parsing of 64-bit Message fields.
    Thanks to pyCube for reporting this bug!
  * Cleaned up miscellaneous errors in the autodoc header comments.

v2.47 - Released 2/26/04
  - The muscle code now supports a -DMUSCLE_AVOID_NAMESPACES compile
    flag that will cause all namespacing directives to be commented out.
  * Fixed an off-by-one error in String::SwapContents() that would cause
    memory corruption if the longer of the two strings contained 7 bytes.
  * The SetFromArchive() methods of the AndOrQueryFilter and
    the NandNotQueryFilter classes were broken.  Fixed.
  * UDP didn't work in Windows, because sin_family wasn't being set.  Fixed.
  * Fixed a bug that would cause ambiguities in the semantics of the
    PR_RESULT_DATAITEMS Message, if a subscribed database node was updated
    and then deleted immediately afterwards.

v2.46 - Released 1/27/04
  - Added some UDP support:  There is now a UDPSocketDataIO class, and the
    following new NetworkUtilityFunctions:  CreateUDPSocket(), BindUDPSocket(),
    SetUDPSocketTarget(), SendDataUDP(), and ReceiveDataUDP().
  - Added some advisory timeslicing support to the PulseNode class.  Now
    any PulseNode subclass can find out when its time-slice started, by
    calling GetCycleStartTime(), set a suggested time-slice-limit by calling
    SetSuggestedMaximumTimeSlice(), and check to see if that time limit is up
    by calling IsSuggestedTimeSliceExpired().  These methods can be used
    to help ensure consistent low latency to all clients.
  - Added a MathSetupSystem class (included in the CompleteSetupSystem class).
    This class disables BorlandC's floating point exceptions, to avoid
    crashing when a floating point exception occurs.
  - Added callback function arguments to CloneDataNodeSubtree(), to allow
    you to easily customize the Message payload of any nodes that it creates.
  - Added String::SwapContents() and Queue::SwapContents() methods for
    efficient (O(1)) state swapping between objects of these classes.
  - Added a HandleStandardDaemonArgs() function to MiscUtilityFunctions.
    This function parses command line arguments that are of general use.
  - Added a muscleSgn() convenience template function to MuscleSupport.h.
  o DisconnectSession() now returns a bool indicating whether or not
    the session decided to terminate itself.
  o Moved BecomeDaemonProcess() and SpawnDaemonProcess() from
    NetworkUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h} to MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.
  o Rewrote muscledMain() to parse arguments using ParseArgs() and
    HandleStandardDaemonArgs(), rather than by looking at argv directly.
  o Rewrote Thread::InternalThreadEntry() to be cleaner.
  o Rewrote String::Replace() to be much more efficient.  Also, it now returns
    the number of substring replacements done, rather than an error code.
  * Failed asynchronous-connect-attempts instigated by a call to
    AddNewConnectSession() were not being detected under Windows.  Fixed.
  * Calling AbstractReflectSession::Reconnect() from inside the
    AbstractReflectSession::ClientConnectionClosed() method now works properly.
  * Calling AddNewSession(ref, int) with an AbstractReflectSession that
    already had a DataIO object installed would cause the pre-installed
    DataIO object to be deleted and replaced.  Now the pre-installed
    DataIO object is retained, instead.
  * SharedMemory::SetArea() with a zero createSize parameter now works
    correctly under Windows.

v2.45 - Released 11/10/03
  - Added GetNextKeyAndValue() convenience methods to the Hashtable class.
  - Added an Atoll() function to MiscUtilityFunctions, to complement
    the already included Atoull() function.
  - Added a Pad() convenience method to the String class, for easy
    padding of a string to a given minimum length.
  - Added SetSocketSendBufferSize() and SetSocketReceiveBufferSize()
    functions to the NetworkUtilityFunctions function collection.
  - Added a ConvertReturnValueToMuscleSemantics() function to MuscleSupport.h,
    and modified the various DataIO classes to call this function instead of
    each one reimplementing the conversion-logic separately.
  - Added QString-style Arg() methods to the String class, so that numeric values
    can be inserted into strings in a convenient and relatively safe manner.
  o Moved the PreviousOperationWouldBlock() and PreviousOperationWasInterrupted()
    functions from NetworkUtilityFunctions.h to MuscleSupport.h, since they
    weren't really networking-specific.
  o Moved the %llu's and %lli's into MuscleSupport.h constants
    INT64_FORMAT_SPEC and UINT64_FORMAT_SPEC, so that they are
    defined correctly for different compilers (some expect %Lu instead).
  * GetRunTime64() now contains a work-around for a bug in Windows'
    QueryPerformanceCounter() function that would cause time to "skip ahead"
    under certain motherboard chipsets.  See system/SetupSystem.cpp for details.
  * Under Windows, GetCurrentTime64() was returning microseconds-since-1601.
    Fixed it to return microseconds-since-1970, as documented.
  * GetCurrentThreadId() was misspelled in Win32Support.h.  Fixed.
  * Renamed the SWAP_* macros to B_SWAP_*, for consistency with the
    naming convention used in the other macros.
  * The FileDescriptorDataIO class now handles EINTR and EWOULDBLOCK
    return values appropriately, instead of erroring out.

v2.44 - Released 09/15/03
  - The QAcceptSocketsThread and QMessageTransceiverThread constructors
    now take optional parent and name arguments, which are passed on to the
    QObject constructor.
  - The QAcceptSocketsThread and QMessageTransceiverThread destructors
    now call ShutdownInternalThread(), so you no lnoger have to call it
    yourself if you don't want to.
  - Added a setNotifyOutputQueueDrainedTag() method to MessageTransceiver.java,
    so that the user thread can be notified when the output queue drains.
    Thanks to Bryan Varner for this code.
  - Added a Replace() method to the Tuple class.
  * Some of the SetFromArchive() calls in MultiQueryFilter and its
    subclasses didn't mark their argument as const.  Fixed.
  * Queue::AddTail(const ItemType *, uint32) was broken.  Fixed.
  * Removed reference to QEvent::MaxUser from the QMessageTransceiverThread
    class, so that it can be compiled against Qt 2.3.
  * Replaced calls to QThread::postEvent() with QApplication::postEvent().

v2.43 - Released 08/19/03
  - Added an optional (count) argument to String::Append() and
    String::Prepend().
  - Added a DisconnectSession() method to the AbstractReflectSession class.
    Calling this method force-disconnects the session's TCP connection.
  - PR_COMMAND_SETDATA now processes multiple sets to the same node in
    a single Message.
  - Added a (numPreallocSlots) argument to the Queue::EnsureSize() method,
    so you can specify how many extra slots to preallocate in the event
    of an array reallocation.
  - Added SetSignalHandle(), SetSignalValue(), and SetReplyThreadID()
    methods to the Win32MessageTransceiverThread class.
  * Fixed a bug in Hashtable::Clear() that could cause crashes under
    certain circumstances (iterators weren't being unregistered reliably).
  * Fixed a bug in the Queue class that was disabling queue-slot-preallocation,
    making calls to AddHead() and AddTail() inefficient -- O(N) instead
    of amortized O(1).  Oops!
  * The Win32 implementation of GetHumanReadableTimeString() was returning
    date strings 369 years too early.  Fixed.

v2.42 - Released 7/15/03
  o DebugTimer's default minimum-print time is now 1000 (1 millisecond)
  o DeflateMessage()'s force parameter now defaults to true.
  * Fixed a bug in PathMatcher::MatchesPath() that would cause absolute
    paths to not be matched correctly.  Thanks to VitViper and Monni for
    reporting this bug!
  * ReflectServer::GetServerUptime() was broken.  Thanks to Monni
    for finding this bug!
  * The first call to Queue::EnsureSize() no longer does an implicit doubling
    of the initial array size, since it's likely that the caller to EnsureSize()
    has the best idea of how many slots are needed, and thus shouldn't be
    second-guessed.

v2.41 - Released 6/27/03
  - Added an sdlsupport folder with Shard's SDLMessageTransceiverThread class
    in it.  This class interfaces MUSCLE to the SDL game library.  Thanks Shard!
  - Added a PRINT_CALLS_PER_SECOND macro to TimeUtilityFunctions.h
  - Added a PreviousOperationWasInterrupted() function to NetworkUtilityFunctions.h
  - ZLibCodec::GetInflatedSize() now takes an optional second argument which
    can be used to find out if the given compressed buffer is independent or not.
  - Added ZLibUtilities.{cpp,h} to the zlib folder.  This file contains
    InflateMessage() and DeflateMessage() functions that are handy for
    compressing Messages down into a flattened state for efficient storage.
  - Added a muscleRealloc() function to GlobalMemoryAllocator.h, to go with
    the already existing muscleAlloc() and muscleFree() functions.
  - The String and ByteBuffer classes now use muscleRealloc() when
    appropriate, to avoid unnecessary data copying while resizing buffers.
  - Added a minimum-log-time argument to the DebugTimer class so that
    printing of very small time intervals can be suppressed.
  - Added a GetNumPreallocatedSlots() accessor method to Hashtable.
  - Added GetHumanReadableTimeString() and ParseHumanReadableTimeString()
    functions to util/MiscUtilityFunctions.h.  These functions convert uint64
    time values to ASCII "YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS" strings, and vice versa.
  o SetupSystem's constructor is now protected, to make sure nobody declares
    a SetupSystem object by itself (they should use CompleteSetupSystem instead)
  o Removed the (copyBuffer) argument from the ByteBuffer constructor and
    several associated methods, because it was error prone and not
    very useful.
  * Fixed a crashing bug in Queue.AddHead(const Queue &)
  * SharedUsageLimitProxyMemoryAllocator::AllocationFailed() was broken.  Fixed.
  * String::SetCstr() would store bytes past the NUL terminator of the passed-in
    string if (maxLen) was too large.  Fixed.
  * Made String::Substring() is more efficient, and it now handles
    out-of-range values gracefully, instead of throwing an assertion failure.
  * The String constructor and SetCstr() took an int32 for (maxLen).
    Now they take a uint32 instead.
  * Replaced calls to CreateThread() with calls to _beginthreadex() in the
    Win32 implementation of the RS232DataIO and Thread APIs.
  * The (independent) flag to ZLibCodec::Deflate() wasn't working properly.
    Fixed.  (The ZLibCodec header format has also changed slightly)

v2.40 - Released 6/2/03
  - MUSCLE is now licensed under the standard BSD Open Source License.
    (Previously it used an equivalent but non-standard license)
  - Added the optional zlib compression library to the MUSCLE archive.
    (Add -DMUSCLE_ZLIB_ENCODING_ENABLED to your Makefile to enable it)
  - Added 9 levels of ZLib encodings to the MessageIOGateway class
    (MUSCLE_MESSAGE_ENCODING_ZLIB_1, ..., MUSCLE_MESSAGE_ENCODING_ZLIB_9)
  - Added QueryFilter objects (regex/QueryFilter.{cpp,h}) to allow queries
    to be restricted to include only nodes whose data Messages match
    user-specified criteria.
  - Rewrote the PathMatcher class and API to support QueryFilter objects.
  - Added a PR_NAME_FILTERS keyword that can be added to commands (along
    with PR_NAME_KEYS) to restrict results based on a QueryFilter.
  - Added a QueryFilterRef parameter to the SendMessageToMatchingSessions(),
    FindMatchingSessions(), and RemoveDataNodes() methods of the
    StorageReflectSession class.
  - Rewrote the MessageIOGateway implementation and protected API to
    use ByteBuffers, in order to better support ZLib encoding.
  - Added a PR_NAME_REPLY_ENCODING parameter to StorageReflectConstants.
    This parameter can be used to tell muscled to compress Messages that
    it sends back to your client.
  - Added a SetOutgoingMessageEncoding() method to the
    MessageTransceiverThread class.
  - Added a GetRunTime64() function to TimeUtilityFunctions.h.  This
    function is similar to GetCurrentTime64(), except it is not synced
    to the real-time clock, and thus is guaranteed not to jump around
    (e.g. when the user sets the system clock, or during leap-seconds)
    GetRunTime64() is now used instead of GetCurrentTime64() where appropriate.
  - Added a Reset() method to all the AbstractMessageIOGateway classes,
    so that they can be re-used after a disconnect or parse error.
  - Merged in Bryan Varner's enhancements to the Java muscle code.
    These include a new Preferences wrapper class, and non-exception
    throwing get*() methods in Message class.  Thanks, Bryan!
  - Calls to the installed LogCallbacks are now checked so that
    re-entrant calls (read: infinite recursion) cannot occur.
  - StorageReflectSession::SendMessageToSessions() and
    StorageReflectSession::FindMatchingSessions() now take
    a (matchSelf) boolean argument.
  - Optimized the Hashtable class to be a bit more efficient.
  - Added an AddPathFromString() convenience method to the PathMatcher class.
  - Added a muscleVoidPointer convenience typedef to MuscleSupport.h
  - Added IsReadyForInput() and HasBytesToOutput() methods to the
    AbstractReflectSession class; ReflectServer now calls these,
    and the default implementations pass the calls through to the gateway.
  - Added a GetOrPut() convenience method to the Hashtable class.
    (handy for demand-allocated Hashtable entries)
  - ByteBuffers no longer re-allocate their memory buffer when
    they are resized smaller.
  - Added DebugTimer.{cpp,h} to the utils subfolder.  This class
    is useful for quick-and-dirty profiling of code execution times.
  - Added a GetTimeSliceElapsedTime() method to the ServerComponent
    class, so that sessions and factories can see how much time
    they have taken so far in their current cycle iteration.
  - Added an EnsureSize() method to the Hashtable class, to support
    pre-allocating tables (for efficiency).
  - Added item-array implementations of AddHead() and AddTail()
    to the Queue class.
  - Added optional startIndex and numItems arguments to the Queue-arg
    implementations of AddHead() and AddTail() in the Queue class.
  - Updated the Beginner's Guide HTML to document QueryFilters,
    ZLib encoding parameters, and a few other details that had
    been left out of it.
  o Moved the ByteBufferPool functions from Message.{cpp,h} to
    ByteBuffer.{cpp,h}.
  o Demoted certain log messages from MUSCLE_LOG_INFO priority
    to MUSCLE_LOG_DEBUG priority.
  o Adjusted the DECLARE_MUSCLE_TRAVERSAL_CALLBACK macro to make
    it more reusable in StorageReflectSession subclasses.
  o The ByteBuffer class now refers to its data as an array of uint8's,
    rather than using void pointers.
  * RateLimitIOSessionPolicy would divide by zero if you
    specified a rate limit of zero bytes per second.  Fixed.
  * RS232DataIO::GetAvailableSerialPortNames() now works correctly
    under MacOS/X.
  * Fixed a couple of VC++-specific code problems.
  * Fixed a bug that was causing Messages sent to a
    MessageTransceiverThread to be sent back to the user thread.
  * StorageReflectSession::FindMatchingSessions() was broken.  Fixed.

v2.31 - Released 4/14/03
  - Rewrote the Hashtable class so that it no longer needs to
    allocate HashtableEntries dynamically during hash clashes.
  - Added in a remapping layer to the HashtableEntries so that
    Hashtable operations can be efficient even when the Hashtable
    is full or nearly full.  Removed the (loadFactor) argument to
    the Hashtable constructor.
  - Lowered the Hashtable's default (initialCapacity) to 7.
  - Added some new optional parameters to StorageReflectSession's
    SetDataNode() and CloneDataNodeSubtree() methods to allow for
    more control over how nodes get placed into their parent's index.
  - Added muscleAlloc() and muscleFree() calls to the
    GlobalMemoryAllocator.h API, for those who like C-style
    memory management.
  - Added GetArrayPointer() methods to the Queue class.  This
    enables efficient bulk-manipulation of items in the Queue.
  - Added an optional node-name argument to DataNode::InsertOrderedChild().
  - Added an optional "releaseDataBuffers" argument to the Clear()
    methods of Queue, Hashtable, and Message classes, to force
    the immediate release of internally held memory buffers.
  - Added GetNumAllocatedItemSlots() method to the Queue class.
  - Added a muscleRintf() function to MuscleSupport.h
  - Added a Win32MessageTransceiverThread class to the winsupport
    folder.  This subclass interfaces the MessageTransceiverThread
    class to the Win32 event API.
  - Added support for MUSCLE_DISABLE_DEBUGGING compile-time
    flag to turn all Log(), LogTime(), etc calls into no-ops.
  - Added a GetGlobalMuscleLock() function that returns a process-wide
    Mutex for simple serialization of Log operations, etc.
  - Added an argument for enabling Nagle's algorithm to
    CreateConnectedSocketPair().  Defaults to false/disabled.
  - Added a GetPosition() method to the DataIO interface and
    all subclasses thereof.
  * Fixed a bug in RestoreNodeTreeFromMessage() that would
    sometimes cause indexed nodes not to be restored.
  * Fixed a bug in Queue::EnsureSize(x, true) where sometimes it
    _itemCount wouldn't be properly set after a successful call.
  * Some of the byte-order-swap macros weren't handling complex
    arguments correctly.  Added extra parentheses to fix them.
  * Added support for a -DMUSCLE_AVOID_NEWNOTHROW flag that will
    tell all MUSCLE code to use new instead of new (nothrow).
  * Trim() will no longer strip UTF8 chars from the end of a String.
  * Fixed a bug in the RateLimitSessionIOPolicy that would cause
    rate-limited transfers to occasionally stall.  Thanks to
    Garjala for all his help in tracking this problem down!
  * Sessions that are about to be destroyed now have DoOutput()
    called on them, in case they have any last-second data to send.
  * Muscle now includes <new> instead of <new.h> to avoid gcc warnings.
  * MessageIOGateway::DoInputImplementation() would sometimes hold
    on to a large memory buffer instead of freeing it immediately.  Fixed.
  * muscleAbs() was returning int instead of the templated type.  Fixed.

v2.30 - Released 3/03/03
  - Added a SharedMemory class to the system folder.  This class
    acts as a platform-neutral wrapper API for the host OS's
    cross-process-shared-memory-area facilitities.
  - Rewrote the MemoryAllocator API to be more flexible.
  - ReflectServer's constructor now takes a MemoryAllocator
    pointer instead of a UsageLimitProxyMemoryAllocator pointer.
  - Added a SharedUsageLimitProxyMemoryAllocator class that
    uses a small shared memory area to allow multiple daemon
    processes to share a single aggregate memory-usage cap.
  - Added a Reconnect() method to the AbstractReflectSession
    class.  This lets a session that was added with
    AddNewConnectSession() restore his connection if it breaks.
  - Added a GetSessionDescriptionString() method to the
    AbstractReflectSession class, for convenience.
  - Added GetAsyncConnectIP() and GetAsyncConnectPort()
    methods to AbstractReflectSession, for convenience.
  - Added a FindMatchingSessions() method to the
    StorageReflectSession class, for convenience.
  - GetPathDepth() now handles paths without a leading slash correctly.
  - Added SetSocketNaglesAlgorithmEnabled(), ShutdownSocket(),
    SendData(), ReceiveData(), and PreviousOperationWouldBlock()
    to the NetworkUtilities function collection.
  - Added IsBlockingIOEnabled() and IsNaglesAlgorithmEnabled()
    accessor methods to the TCPSocketDataIO class.
  - Added the AbstractGatewayMessageReceiver interface, and the
    QueueGatewayMessageReceiver convenience class.
  - Rewrote ReflectServer::ServerProcessLoop() to be slightly
    more efficient and fair.
  - Added a (void *) misc-utility argument to the
    MessageReceivedFromGateway() method, and made it part of
    the AbstractGatewayMessageReceiver interface.
  - Added testnagle.cpp and testresponse.cpp to the test folder.
  o Inet_NtoA() no longer returns a String object, since that
    requires the String class to be linked in to programs that
    could otherwise live without it.
  o Rewrote the AbstractMessageIOGateway API to be more efficient.
    Gateways no longer maintain a Queue of incoming Messages; rather,
    whenever they parse a Message they immediately pass it to a
    specified AbstractGatewayMessageReceiver object.
  o AbstractMessageIOGateway subclasses no longer override DoInput()
    and DoOutput() directly.  Instead, they should implement/override
    DoInputImplementation() and DoOutputImplementation().
  o Moved the StringMatcher and StringMatcherQueue singleton
    ObjectPools out of the StorageReflectSession class and into
    the StringMatcher.cpp and PathMatcher.cpp files, respectively.
    They can now be accessed anywhere, via the functions
    GetStringMatcherPool() and GetStringMatcherQueuePool().
  o PathMatcher no longer accepts pointers to ObjectPools in its
    AddPathString() methods -- instead it just always uses
    the appropriate singleton ObjectPools.
  o Removed the type_code data type; now uint32 is used instead.
  o Removed the PulseNode::Tick() method hook, since it turned
    out to be unnecessary and encourages bad programming habits.
  * ReflectServer's status output is now more informative.
  * The ThreadSetupSystem and NetworkSetupSystem classes now
    handle multiple nested instantiations gracefully.
  * TCPSocketDataIO's Read() and Write() calls would return an
    error code for zero-length reads or writes.  Fixed.
  * PathMatcher::MatchesPath() wasn't giving correct results
    for paths with leading slashes.  Fixed.
  * TCPSocketDataIO::FlushOutput() wasn't working in OS/X.  Fixed.

v2.25 - Released 2/04/03
  - Renamed Hashtable::Get() to GetValue() (Get() is preserved
    as a synonym for compatibility with existing code)
  - Added two Hashtable::GetKey() methods to allow quick lookup
    of held key objects.
  - Added a PrintStackTrace() function to the SysLog module.
    MCRASH() and MASSERT() now call PrintStackTrace() so you
    get more debug info when you crash.  (Only works under gcc)
  - Added a (setNumItems) argument to Queue::EnsureSize(), which
    can be handy if you want to add or remove a large number of
    default data items at once.
  - Updated MessageTransceiver.java with Bryan Varner's changes.
  - Hashtable::Sort() now uses Simon Tatham's very efficient
    merge-sort algorithm instead of insertion sort.
  - Added ToString() and AddToString() methods to the Message class.
  - Added a SetCstr() method to the String class.
  * binary String operators now return String instead of const String.
  * StorageReflectSession::CloneDataNodeSubtree() was not
    cloning node indices.  Fixed.
  * DataNode::InsertIndexEntryAt() now uses GetKey() so as not
    to have to iterate over the node's child list.

v2.24 - Released 11/15/02
  - Added an "oldData" argument to StorageReflectSession's
    NotifySubscribersThatNodeChanged() and NodeChanged() methods,
    and removed the NodeCreated() and NotifySubscribersOfNewNode()
    methods (since they are now redundant).
  - Added a "backwards" flag argument to Message::GetFieldNameIterator(),
    and added a Message::GetFieldNameIteratorAt() method.
  - Added a GetBlankMessage() convenience method to the
    StorageReflectSession class.  This method returns a reference to
    an empty Message.
  - Optimized the tree search traversal algorithm so that non-wildcard
    patterns do a single hash lookup instead of matching against every
    child node.
  - Added GetPattern() and IsPatternUnique() methods to the
    StringMatcher class.
  - StringMatcher::SetPattern and the StringMatcher constructor
    now take a (const String &) instead of a (const char *).
  - Merged in Bryan's enhancements the the Java classes.  The
    Jave MUSCLE API now includes better support in the
    MessageTransceiver class for listening for incoming TCP
    connections, and a way to interrupt() the current Thread
    running in a MessageQueue.
  - String::Replace() now returns a status_t to indicate whether
    any replacements were actually made or not.
  * QMessageTransceiverThread was using an illegal event code to
    signal the master thread of new network events.  Fixed.

v2.23 - Released 11/01/02
  - Added RS232DataIO.{cpp,h} to allow for simple serial port I/O.
    Currently it only works under Windows and Linux; support for
    other OS's may be added in the future, if there is need for it.
  - Exposed the AddPyObjectToMessage() function in the Python
    argument-conversion-utilities package.
  * Cleaned up the various comparison operators to return bool
    instead of int, and the equality-adjustment operators to
    return (Class &) instead of (const Class &)
  * Tweaked the code to compile cleanly under gcc 3.x.

v2.22 - Released 10/16/02
  - Added PR_COMMAND_SETDATATREE, PR_COMMAND_GETDATATREE,
    and PR_JETTISON_SUBTREES commands, and a PR_RESULT_DATATREE
    reply.  These can be used to conveniently get and set
    database subtrees.
  - MessageGateways now free their scratch buffers if they
    are bigger than 10 kilobytes, so as not to waste memory after
    having sent or received a very large Message.
  * Integrated Monni the Cat's VC++6 compatibility tweaks.
  * Fixed a horrendously embarrassing memory leak in muscled.
    In fact, ALL of muscled's heap memory allocations were being
    leaked, as of v2.18.  Sorry guys, that was a really dumb
    mistake.  :^(

v2.21 - Released 10/08/02
  - Added a muscleAbs() utility template to MuscleSupport.h
  - Queue::RemoveItemAt() and Queue::InsertItemAt() have been
    optimized a bit -- they should be about twice as fast now.
  - Added a GetLogLevelKeyword() function to SysLog.h
  - StringMatcher::SetPattern() now looks for an optional tilde
    character ('~') at the beginning of simple patterns; if it
    finds it, it sets a negate flag so that Match() will return
    the logical opposite of what it usually would return.
  - Added manual SetNegate() and IsNegate() methods to the
    StringMatcher class.
  - IsRegexToken() now takes a second argument specifying whether
    the character in question is the first in the string (since
    there are several characters that are only 'special' when they
    are the leading character)
  - Database node paths are no longer cached, to save memory.
    Instead, GetNodePath() now generates the node-path on the fly,
    as needed.  Because of this, the function signatures of
    GetNodePath() and GetNodeName() have changed.
  - Added a handy DataNode::GetPathClause() method that allows
    quick access to the node name at a specified depth in
    a node's path.
  * Queue::GetItemPointer() is now named GetItemAt().  (The old
    name is still available, but deprecated).
  * The PowerPC assembly implementation of atomic increment and
    decrement wasn't being used under OS/X.  Fixed.

v2.20 - Released 9/05/02
  - Added a () convenience operator to the MessageFieldNameIterator
    class.  It operates as a synonym for GetNextFieldNameString().
  - Added PythonUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}, which currently includes
    two functions, ConvertMessageItemToPyObject(). and
    ParsePythonArgs().  These are useful when embedding Python
    and MUSCLE C++ code into the same application.
  - Added ParseArg() and ParseFile() methods to MiscUtilityFunctions
    .cpp and .h files.  These parse an argument (ParseArgs()) style
    out of a single string, or a FILE pointer, respectively.
  - Added a GetScheduledPulseTime() to the PulseNode class.  This
    method returns the time at which Pulse() will next be called.
  - Added a muscleCompare template that returns -1 if the first arg
    is greater than the second, or 0 if they are equal, or else 1.
  - Added an Atoull() function to turn an ASCII string into a uint64.
    (useful since atoll() and atoull() aren't standard functions)
  - Added a SendMessageToMatchingSessions() convenience method to
    the StorageReflectSession class.
  - Added a dev-c++ subfolder that contains project files suitable
    for compiling muscled under Windows' Dev/C++ IDE.  (Thanks
    to Marcin "Shard" Konicki for supplying these!)
  - Added inline x86 assembly atomic-increment and atomic-decrement
    code to AtomicCounter.h.
  - Added a "remap" argument to muscled, and corresponding accessor
    methods to ReflectServer, to support explicit remapping of IP
    addresses (e.g. so you can tell muscled to advertise local LAN
    machines by their world-accessible IP address)
  * AtomicCounter.h no longer relies on the (non-portable)
    asm/atomic.h API when compiled under Linux.
  * ParseArgs() now parses argv[0] as well as the others.
  * BeOS/net_server bone-check in FinalizeAsyncConnection() now uses
    be_roster->IsRunning() if possible for more accurate results on
    systems where BONE has been installed and then disabled.
  * Fixed a bug that would cause an assertion failure if you called
    ReverseItemOrdering() on an empty Queue.
  * StringMatcher's wildcard-to-regex code was overly complicated
    and broken, especially when using the included regex parser (i.e.
    under Windows).  Rewritten to be simpler and work right.
  * When set to a numeric-range pattern like "<0-50>", StringMatcher
    now only considers matches on strings that start with a digit.

v2.19 - Released 7/22/02
  - Added a GetPathClauseString() method to PathMatcher.{cpp.h}.
    This version returns a String object containing just the one
    clause you specified.
  * GetPathClause() was not returning NULL on failure.  Fixed.
  * When presented with an unknown hostname, MessageTransceiverThread
    would sometimes try to connect to IP address 0.0.0.0 instead of
    failing cleanly.  Fixed.
  * The NodeCreated() callback would see the newly created node with
    an empty Message payload.  Now it sees the node complete with the
    Message it was created to have.
  * The Win32 implementation of Thread::StartInternalThreadAux() wasn't
    handling the return value of CreateThread(), which in turn caused
    Thread::ShutdownInternalThread() to not work properly.  Fixed.
    (Thanks to VitViper for detecting this bug!)
  * The BeOS/net_server implementation of FinalizeAsyncConnection()
    would cause net_server to half-close the connection after 60
    seconds if no send or receive activity had occurred by then.  Fixed.

v2.18 - Released 7/4/02
  - Removed checks for DISABLE_MUSCLE_MEMORY_TRACKING, and put in
    checks for MUSCLE_ENABLE_MEMORY_TRACKING instead.  In other words,
    memory tracking is now disabled unless the Makefile says otherwise.
    The muscled Makefile contains -DMUSCLE_ENABLE_MEMORY_TRACKING, so
    memory tracking is enabled by default for muscled.
  - Added two GetNumInstancesOf() methods to the String class; these
    are handy for counting how many instances of a substring are
    present in a String.
  - DefaultConsoleLogger now calls fflush() after every call to printf().
  - Added a Reverse() method to the String class.
  - Added a muscleInRange() function template to MuscleSupport.h
    This function tests whether a given value is within a given range.
  * The 'maxmem' argument is no longer parsed if muscled was compiled
    without -DMUSCLE_ENABLE_MEMORY_TRACKING.
  * The '==' operator of the Message class had a bug in which
    Messages would sometimes be wrongly reported as equivalent
    when they weren't.  Fixed.
  * Message class now holds its fields using a table of GenericRefs
    instead of AbstractDataArrayRefs (to avoid errors under compilers
    that don't like creating templates for declared-but-undefined classes)
  * The MemoryAllocator class hierarchy has been rewritten so that it
    no longer allocates or frees memory directly; rather it is used only
    to monitor and/or veto memory requests called in by the new and delete
    operators.  This makes it work better with the constructors and
    destructors of static objects, and fixes a crash-on-exit bug in
    muscled.
  * Folded in Charlie Buckheit's SGI compatibility changes into the
    muscled Makefile, made the Makefile simpler, and added comments.

v2.17 - Released 6/14/02
  - Message class now uses ObjectPools to cache extra AbstractDataArray
    objects, to avoid having to dynamically allocate them most of the
    time.  You can define MUSCLE_DISABLE_MESSAGE_FIELD_POOLS to suppress
    this behaviour, if you need to.
  - AtomicCounter now uses inline assembly to implement atomic operations
    on the PowerPC processor with gcc, and the asm/atomic.h functions when
    under Linux/Intel.
  - Added '==' and '!=' operators to the Message class.
  - Modified Head() and Tail() in the Queue class to return read-only
    or read-write references to the head or tail items, instead of
    doing return-by-value.
  - Added PeekNextFieldNameString() and GetNextFieldNameString() methods
    to the MessageFieldNameIterator class.  These return a (const String *)
    instead of a (const char *), which is sometimes more efficient.
  * MessageFieldNameIterator::PeekNextFieldNameString() was broken.  Fixed.
  * AtomicCounter::AtomicIncrement() and RefCountable::IncrementRefCount()
    now return void instead of bool (Linux doesn't support returning bool)

v2.16 - Released 6/5/02
  - Added SetNewInputPolicy(), SetNewOutputPolicy(), and
    RemoveSessions() methods to the MessageTransceiverThread class.
    These methods allow for some on-the-fly control of existing
    ThreadWorkerSessions.
  - Added comparison operators (less than, greater than, etc)
    to the Tuple class template.  These do a lexical comparison
    using the comparison operators of each sub-element, in sequence.
  - syslog/SysLog.h now looks for a MUSCLE_MINIMALIST_LOGGING
    preprocessor constant.  If found, Log(), LogTime(), and LogFlush()
    will be defined as simple in-line pass-throughs to printf().
    This allows small programs to use MUSCLE classes without having
    to link in all the stuff that the regular logging facility
    requires.
  - Added GetKeyAt() and IndexOfKey() methods to the Hashtable class.
  - Added two Substring() convenience methods to the String class,
    that take a String as an argument.
  - Added a GetNumInstancesOf() method to the Tuple class.
  * To ensure logical correctness, all methods in the Hashtable class
    that used to return (Key *) now return (const Key *).
  * Folded in VitViper's Visual C++ compatibility fixes.

v2.15 - Released 5/17/02
  - The Hashtable class now uses a HashFunctor template argument
    to calculate hash codes, instead of a function callback.  This
    allows for more efficient code, but will break some source
    code (sorry!).  To fix the souce, you typically just need to
    remove the function pointer argument to the Hashtable ctor.
  - Broke out the log-line-label-generation code in SysLog.cpp
    into its own separate function, GetStandardLogLinePreamble(),
    so that it can be accessed independently by other code.
  - Changed the Hashtable class's performance parameters to
    capacity=11, loadFactor=75%.  This should save some memory.
  - Added an AfterMessageReceivedFromGateway() callback method
    to the AbstractReflectSession class.  PushSubscriptionMessages()
    is now called by this method, rather than having to be
    called manually by the subclasses.
  - Added a CallMessageReceivedFromGateway() method to the
    AbstractReflectSession class.  This method calls both
    MessageReceivedFromGateway() and AfterMessageReceivedFromGateway(),
    and should be used to 'fake' message reception (instead of
    calling the aforementioned methods directly).
  - Optimized the PushSubscriptions() method with a dirty-flag.
  - Added the muscleCopyIn() and muscleCopyOut() templates to
    MuscleSupport.h.  These support alignment-safe value copying.
  - Added a GetEmptyMessage() utility function to Message.{cpp,h}
  - ObjectPool now derives from AbstractObjectManager, which in
    turn derives from AbstractObjectGenerator and AbstractObjectRecycler.
    This helps me use pools polymorphically.
  * The ServerComponent detach/delete sequence is now better defined,
    avoiding possible errors that could occur in custom servers.
  * A little more OS/X compatibility tweaking.
  * Some of the Flatten/Unflatten code would crash on processors
    (e.g. MIPS) that required values to be read on written on
    word-aligned boundaries.  Fixed.  (Thanks to Charlie Buckheit
    for reporting this bug)
  * Fixed a race condition in the Thread class that would cause
    the thread's owner to not be signalled correctly in some cases.

v2.14 - Released 5/2/02
  * The Python Message implementation now flattens/unflattens
    B_INT64_TYPE fields properly even under old (pre 2.2) versions
    of Python.
  * Bryan Varner found and fixed a bug in the Java Message class;
    it wasn't handling the sending and receiving of UTF8 strings
    correctly.  Thanks Bryan!
  * Removed the B_POINTER_TYPE from the Java Message implementation,
    since Java doesn't have pointers, and flattening a pointer into
    a Message that goes across the network is a silly thing to do
    anyway.
  * Changed all instances of #include <winsock2.h> to
    #include <winsock.h>, since Muscle does not require any
    WinSock2-specific features.
  * The included fall-back regex library is now Henry Spencer's
    public domain implementation, instead of the GPL'd GNU version.
  * The Windows version of Thread::StartInternalThread() was broken.
    Thanks to VitViper for finding and fixing this bug!

v2.13 - Released 4/26/02
  - Added Python support, with Message and MessageTransceiverThread
    classes, and pythonchat, a BeShare-compatible command-line
    demo chat app.  Check out the README.TXT file in the python
    subfolder for details.
  - Added a readmessage.cpp utility to the test folder.
  - Added |= and &= operators to the Rect class.
  - StorageReflectSession methods NodeChanged(), NodeIndexChanged(),
    and NodeCreated() are now declared as virtual.
  * String::Trim() would crash with an assertion failure on some
    systems, due to incorrect handling of unsigned values.  Thanks
    to Austin M. Brower (a.k.a. bobman) for catching this bug!
  * Tweaked the Makefiles and the SetupSystem.cpp file so that they
    compile properly under OS/X.  (thanks again to Austin for this)
  * Fixed some problems that kept muscled from compiling under VC++.
  * Added a couple of checks to Message::Unflatten() to keep it from
    crashing if given a mangled flattened-Message to parse.

v2.12 - Released 4/4/02
  - Added a SetAboutToFlattenCallback() method to the MessageIOGateway
    class.  This allows you to install a hook that gets called when
    a Message is about to be flattened, in which you can modify or
    inspect the Message.
  - gcc now compiles muscled with the -fno-exceptions flag, resulting
    in somewhat more efficient code since muscle doesn't use exceptions
    anyway.
  - Added a muscleClamp() utility function to MuscleSupport.h.
  - Added << and >> operators to the Tuple declaration macros.
  - Removed the default/blank member items from the Tuple, Queue,
    and Hashtable classes, as I finally found a way to declare them
    properly on the stack instead.  This should save some memory.
  * Snooze64() and GetCurrentTime64() were broken under Windows.  Fixed.
  * Added a MUSCLE_MAX_OUTPUT_CHUNK #ifdef into ReflectServer.cpp, so
    that people with finicky routers can limit their send-chunk sizes
    by putting a -D flag into their Makefile if necessary.
  o Removed TCPSocketDataIO::PollSocketReadiness(), since it is never
    used, encourages polling, and causes warnings under C++Builder5.5.

v2.11 - Released 2/28/02
  - Added RemoveDataNodes() and DoRemoveData() convenience methods
    to the StorageReflectSession API.
  - Changed the Thread class to have separate
    SetOkayToCloseInternalThreadWakeupSocket() and
    SetOkayToCloseOwnerWakeupSocket() methods, instead of passing
    in a "release" flag with the Get*WakeupSocket() calls.  Also changed
    the Thread class to keep the socket values even when they are
    considered "released", so that signalling will still work if needed.
  * ThreadSupervisorSession::MessageReceivedFromOwner()'s argument list
    was missing a parameter, and thus it wasn't getting called.  Fixed.

v2.10 - Released 2/7/02
  - MUSCLE now supports compilation under Win32 using Borland's
    C++Builder 5.5 compiler.  (use the Makefile in the 'borland' folder)
  - StringMatcher can now (as a special case) do simple integer range
    queries of the form "<15-252>", which would match strings.
    "15", "16", ..., "252".  See StringMatcher::SetPattern() for details.
  - Added RemoveFirstInstanceOf() and RemoveLastInstanceOf() methods
    to the Queue class.
  - Added ByteBuffer and FlatCountable classes to the util folder.
  - Added AddFlat(FlatCountableRef), FindFlat(FlatCountableRef), and
    friends to the Message class.  These allow you to add and retrieve
    FlatCountable objects to/from a Message by reference,
    so that they aren't actually flattened until the Message itself is.
  - Rewrote the Message class to use ByteBufferRefs instead of raw
    byte arrays for its flattened objects and raw data buffers.
    Note that this changes the semantics of these fields slightly--
    copying a Message object will no longer copy the contents of these
    fields, but rather the two Messages will now both reference the
    same data.
  - Pointer fields in Messages are no longer flattened, as the mechanics
    of doing so are non-portable (and silly).
  - All methods in the Message class now take String references instead
    of (const char *)'s for field names.
  - Removed all but one of the Message::GetInfo() methods, since they
    were redundant and/or inconsistent with the rest of the Message API.
  - Moved the "okayToAdd" parameter of the Replace*() methods in the
    Message class to the front of the argument list.  (It was causing
    some nasty problems involving type promotion at its previous position)
  - class ObjectPool now derives from an interface class named
    AbstractObjectRecycler.  Also, the Ref class now holds a pointer to
    an AbstractObjectRecycler, rather than to an ObjectPool.  This allows
    more flexibility when keeping heterogeneous sets of objects referenced.
  - Added optional CopyTo() and CopyFrom() methods to the Flattenable class.
    These methods support copying one Flattenable object to another in the
    most efficient way possible.  Per-class optimizations can be implemented
    by overriding the CopyToImplementation() and CopyFromImplementation()
    virtual methods as desired..
  * Default implementation of Flattenable::AllowsTypeCode() now accepts
    B_RAW_TYPE as well as TypeCode(), to allow unflattening from untyped data.
  * Removed the (char) constructor from the String class, as it was
    interfering with proper type checking of arguments.
  * Changed all index parameters in the Message class to use uint32
    instead of int32 (since negative indices don't make sense).
  * MessageTransceiverThread wasn't adding new sessions asynchronously
    (i.e. after StartInternalThread() had been called).  Fixed.
  * MessageTransceiverThread would not deliver a
    MTT_EVENT_SESSION_DISCONNECTED message to the user code if an
    asynchronous connection to localhost failed.  Fixed.
  * FinalizeAsyncConnect() was using the wrong test and thus sometimes
    thought an asynchronous connection had succeeded when it had in
    fact failed.  Fixed.
  * ConnectAsync() was broken under Windows.  Fixed.

v2.00 - Released 1/19/02
  - All MUSCLE code is now declared as being in the 'muscle' namespace.
    This, plus all the changes listed below, pretty much guarantee that
    any source code that compilable with previous versions of MUSCLE won't
    compile now, and vice versa; sorry about that.  Hopefully everything
    that needed changing has been changed by now though, so it shouldn't
    happen again (well, not soon anyway ;^)).  If you need help updating
    your old MUSCLE-using code, let me know.
  - muscled now parses a 'maxmessagesize' argument, allowing you to limit the
    maximum size of incoming Message objects (so e.g. you don't have to worry
    about some joker sending you 100 megabyte Messages, tying up all your RAM)
  - muscled now parses 'maxsessions' and 'maxsessionsperhost' keywords to allow
    limiting of the number of simultaneous connections, or simultaneous
    connections from any given client IP address.
  - muscled now accepts a 'localhost' keyword which lets you specify what
    the advertised IP address of clients connecting from localhost should be,
    instead of (the rather useless) 127.0.0.1.
  - muscle now accepts the keywords "maxsendrate", "maxreceiverate", and
    "maxcombinedrate" -- these allow you to specify maximum allowed
    bandwidth usage (in KB/sec) for sending, receiving, or both.
  - muscled now accepts a 'require' keyword on the command line as well
    as 'ban', allowing for 'whitelisting' as well as 'blacklisting'.
  - admin now parses 'require' and 'unrequire' keywords on the command line.
  - Removed the word 'Portable' from all class names that had it; since
    muscle is now in its own namespace, a unique prefix is no longer necessary.
  - Completely rewrote the MessageTransceiverThread class.  Now the
    MessageTransceiverThread class is portable code, with optional thin
    OS-specific wrapper subclasses available if you wish to use them.
    Moreover, MessageTransceiverThread now holds its own ReflectServer
    object, which means that it uses the same event loop as the servers
    do, and that a single MessageTransceiverThread object can manage multiple
    incoming and outgoing connections simultaneously.
    BMessageTransceiverThread, QMessageTransceiverThread, and
    AMessageTransceiverThread are the wrappers for BeOS, Qt, and AtheOS,
    respectively.  (MessageTransceiverThread can also be used by itself
    if you prefer to stick with threads-and-TCP only)
  - Split the accept-tcp-sockets-thread functionality into its own
    class, AcceptSocketsThread.  There is also a Qt-specific subclass of
    of this available, named QAcceptSocketsThread.
  - Added a Tuple templated class to the support folder.  This class
    represents an array of numeric values, and is used to do simple
    vector math operations conveniently.
  - Point and Rect (nee PortablePoint and PortableRect) are now derived from
    Tuple, to avoid code duplication.  The formerly public member variables
    x, y, left, top, right, and bottom values are now exposed as
    inline methods instead (e.g. use x() instead of x).
  - Added aggregate bandwidth metering/management capabilities to MUSCLE.
    This includes the introduction of a new interface, AbstractSessionIOPolicy,
    and a bandwidth-limiter subclass, RateLimitSessionIOPolicy.
  - Added a SetMaxIncomingMessageSize() method to the MessageIOGateway class.
  - Added a FilterSessionFactory decorator class, that can be used
    in conjunction with any other ReflectSessionFactory object to enforce
    ban-lists, require-lists, and/or connection limits.
  - ReflectSessionFactory and AbstractReflectSession now have a common base
    class, named ServerComponent, that provides them with limited access to
    their ReflectServer object.
  - Added SetLocalHostIPOverride() and GetLocalHostIPOverride() functions
    to NetworkUtilityFunctions.h, to set a custom IP address to use instead
    of 127.0.0.1 when necessary.
  - Added -= and - operators to the String class.  (you saw it here first!)
  - Added a String constructor and assignment operator for char arg.
  - Renamed ObjectPool::GetObject() to ObtainObject() to avoid a naming
    conflict with a #define in the MS-Windoze headers.  (evil!)
  - ObjectPool class is now thread-safe by default (unless you specify
    -DMUSCLE_SINGLE_THREAD_ONLY in your build line)
  - Added a new subfolder named "system", which contains code for exporting
    OS-specified functionality in a platform-independent manner.  This folder
    currently holds a Mutex class and a Thread class, both of which
    wrap the relevant portions of several supported native APIs:
    BeOS, AtheOS, pthreads, Qt, and Win32.  It also holds the
    new MessageTransceiverThread and AcceptSocketsThread classes, since
    these are special types of Thread, and the GlobalMemoryAllocator.
  - Moved the memory-usage-tracking code out of ReflectServer.cpp and into
    its own file, system/GlobalMemoryAllocator.{cpp,h}.  Now you can choose
    whether or not to link this in to your server.
  - Added util/MemoryAllocator.{cpp,h}.  These files contain a set of
    memory-allocation-handler classes, which can be composed together to
    create a custom memory allocation strategy.  Included subclasses include
    BasicMemoryAllocator, ProxyMemoryAllocator, UsageLimitMemoryAllocator,
    and AutoCleanupMemoryAllocator.
  - Merged PortableTypeConstants.h, PortableTypeDefs.h, PortableByteOrder.h,
    PortableMacros.h, and PortableStatusConstants.h into a single file
    called MuscleSupport.h
  - Renamed the BeOS and AtheOS conversion routines to ConvertToBMessage(),
    ConvertFromBMessage(), ConvertToAMessage(), and ConvertFromAMessage().
  - Added a RawDataMessageIOGateway class to the iogateway folder.  This
    class is handy for reading or writing chunks of unformatted bytes
    to/from a socket.
  - AbstractMessageIOGateway::DoInput() and DoOutput() now return the number
    of bytes that they read/wrote (respectively), or -1 if there was an error.
    (Before they returned a status_t).  They now take a uint32 argument
    instead of a (uint32 &).  The argument now indicates the maximum number
    of bytes they are allowed to read or write before returning.
  - Added an InsertOrderedData() method into StorageReflectSession so
    that subclasses can get more info about what gets inserted where.
  - Added new methods to the Message class:  AddTag(), PrependTag(),
    FindTag(), and ReplaceTag().  These let you assign non-persistent,
    non-flattenable tag objects to a message that will be automatically
    dereferenced when the Message goes away.
  - ReflectSessionFactory classes are now in charge of deciding who
    gets to connect and who doesn't, rather than the StorageReflectSession
    class.  This is useful because it means you can specify different
    access policies for different ports.
  - Removed AbstractReflectSession::GetClientPort() and replaced
    it with the (slightly more useful) GetPort() method, which returns
    the session's port number on the server side, instead.
  - Added AbstractReflectSession::SendMessageToFactory(), and
    ReflectSessionFactory::MessageReceivedFromSession(), so that
    sessions can send instructions to the factories that created them.
  - ReflectSessionFactory::CreateSession() now takes the IP string
    of the remote peer, to allow for filtering on IP addresses.
  - CreateAcceptingSocket() now takes optional arguments to return the
    selected port, and to specify an IP address to only accept from.
  - Added ConnectAsync(), FinalizeAsyncConnect(), GetHostByName(),
    CloseSocket(), Accept(), and Inet_AtoN() functions into the
    NetworkUtilityFunctions toolkit.  Also added a version of Connect() that
    takes a numeric IP address rather than an ASCII string.
  - INet_NtoA() now returns a String instead of writing into a char buffer.
  - Added support for sessions that asynchronously connect outwards from
    the server:  ReflectServer::AddNewConnectSession(),
    AbstractReflectSession::AddNewConnectSession(), and
    the callback AbstractReflectSession::AsyncConnectCompleted().
  - Added SaveNodeTreeToMessage() and RestoreNodeTreeFromMessage()
    methods to StorageReflectSession.  These allow easy recursive
    archiving and restoration of database node subtrees and their indices.
  - Made a bunch of formerly protected members of StorageReflectSession
    private, and added protected accessors for some of them, where necessary.
  - Added sort-by-value capability to the Hashtable class, and rewrote the
    auto-sort interface so that there are separate SetKeyCompareFunction(),
    SetValueCompareFunction(), and SetCompareCookie() methods, as well as
    associated accessor methods.
  - Added Message::GetNumValuesInName().
  - GetMessageFromPool() now returns a MessageRef instead of a Message *,
    to avoid any possibility of a memory leak.
  - Added templated convenience functions muscleSwap(), muscleMin(), and
    muscleMax() to MuscleSupport.h.
  - Added a Shutdown() method to the AbstractMessageIOGateway interface,
    and made AbstractMessageIOGateway::GetDataIO() protected.
  - Added a GetSelectSocket() method to the DataIO interface.  This method
    returns the socket fd to select() on for that DataIO (if any).
  - Removed AbstractMessageIOGateway::SetEnabled() and IsEnabled(), and
    replaced them with the single virtual method IsReadyForInput(), which
    function similarly to HasBytesForOutput().
  - Consolidated the server-side Pulse logic into a single base class,
    PulseNode.  ReflectServers, AbstractMessageIOGateways,
    ReflectSessionFactories, and AbstractReflectSessions now all inherit from
    PulseNode, and thus are all capable of scheduling and receiving Pulse()
    calls for themselves.
    Also renamed ReschedulePulseTime() to InvalidatePulseTime().
  - AbstractDataIOGateway objects no longer take a DataIO pointer in their
    constructor arguments;  instead, a separate SetDataIO(DataIORef) call
    is used to install the DataIO into the gateway.
  - Renamed the constant MUSCLE_NEVER_PULSE to MUSCLE_TIME_NEVER (since
    it is used in situations other than just Pulse() now).
  - Added the constant MUSCLE_NO_LIMIT, which is defined as ((uint32)-1).
  - Separated the DataIO creation from the CreateGateway() callback,
    making CreateGateway() implementations a bit simpler.  Also added
    SetGateway() and GetGateway() methods so you can define a custom
    gateway for your session "in advance" if you want to.
  - Added SetRef(), SetFromGeneric(), and GetGeneric(), conveniences methods
    to the Ref class, as well as a Ref constructor that takes a GenericRef.
  - Renamed AddLogCallback() to PutLogCallback(), and change the arguments
    to take a LogCallbackRef instead of just a pointer.
  - Moved the log callback stuff into its own header file, syslog/LogCallback.h
  - Modified several APIs that were taking a pointer and an "ownIt" boolean
    to take Refs instead.  That way the deletion can be handled automagically.
  - Removed the InitializeTCPStack() method from NetworkUtilityFunctions and
    added instead some SetupSystem classes, including a ThreadSetupSystem,
    a NetworkSetupSystem, and a CompleteSetupSystem.  Placing one of these
    (usually a CompleteSetupSystem) on the stack at the beginning of main()
    is now the correct way to handle all environment setup and tear-down.
  - Added MiscUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h} files to the util subfolder.  These
    contain utility functions that don't fit in anywhere else--currently
    they contain a ParseArgs() function that parses command line arguments
    into a Message object.
  - Added the SignalMessageIOGateway class -- a very simple gateway used
    primarily as a convenience class for thread synchronization.
  - Renamed MessageReceivedFromNeighbor() to MessageReceivedFromSession(),
    and renamed BroadcastMessageToNeighbors() to BroadcastMessageToSessions().
  - Added MessageReceivedFromFactory() and BroadcastMessageToFactory()
    methods to the ServerComponent class and its subclasses.
  - Added util/SocketHolder.h, to facilitate leak-proof socket file descriptor
    transfers via Message objects.
  - merged testreflectclient.cpp and testatheosclient.cpp into a single program,
    and got rid of testplaintextclient.cpp
  * Renamed Queue::CountItems() to GetNumItems(), and renamed Hashtable::Size()
    to GetNumItems(), for clarity and consistency.
  * Renamed all methods named MakeEmpty() to Clear(), for consistency.
  * functions in the SysLog API are now serialized in order to be thread-safe.
  * Removed the UnintrusiveRef class, as it isn't useful enough to keep around.
  * Fixed a bug in the PlainTextMessageIOGateway that would sometimes
    allow garbage characters into the imported text.
  * All TCP port number arguments are now specified as uint16s instead of ints.
  * All usages of size_t and ssize_t have been replaced with
    uint32 and int32, respectively (since that is more explicit/precise).
  * Removed the MUSCLE_CLASS_DECLARATIONS and MUSCLE_FUNCTION_DECLARATIONS
    tokens from the headers, since they didn't have a well-defined meaning.
  * Certain MUSCLE methods were using a non-standard convention of returning
    a boolean value to indicate success or failure.  Modified all of the
    following methods to return a status_t (B_NO_ERROR or B_ERROR) instead:
       HashtableIterator::GetNextKey() HashtableIterator::PeekNextKey()
       HashtableIterator::GetNextValue() HashtableIterator::PeekNextValue()
       Hashtable::Get Hashtable::Put() Hashtable::Remove Hashtable::RemoveAux()
       Hashtable::GrowTable() Hashtable::MoveToFront() Hashtable::MoveToBack()
       Hashtable::MoveToBefore() Hashtable::MoveToBehind() Hashtable::Sort()
       Queue::AddTail() Queue::AddHead() Queue::RemoveTail() Queue::RemoveHead()
       Queue::RemoveItemAt() Queue::GetItemAt() Queue::ReplaceItemAt()
       Queue::InsertItemAt() Queue::EnsureSize()
       AbstractMessageIOGateway::EnsureBufferSize()
       Message::GetNextFieldName() Message::PeekNextFieldName()
       StorageReflectSession::DataNode::PutChild()
       StorageReflectSession::DataNode::InsertOrderedChild()
       StorageReflectSession::DataNode::ReorderChild()
       StorageReflectSession::DataNode::RemoveIndexEntry()
       StringMatcher::SetPattern() Flattenable::ReadData()

v1.93 - Released 12/05/01
  - Added an optional second argument to PortableHashtable::GetIterator(),
    that lets you traverse the hashtable's contents backwards.
  - Added PortableHashtable::GetIteratorAt(), to allow iterations
    that start from any item in the table's traversal list.
  - Changed the compare function type for hash tables to return an int
    (strcmp() style) rather than a bool (== style), so that it can be used
    for sorting as well as comparison.  Also added a (void *) cookie parameter
    so that the callback can access user-defined context information easily.
  - Changed PortableHashtable::SetCompareFunction() to take a second parameter
    specifying whether or not the compare function should be used to auto-sort
    entries as they are placed into the hash table.
  - Added Sort() and Sort(compareFunc) methods to PortableHashtable to allow
    in-place traversal order sorting.
  - Added the PR_COMMAND_REORDERDATA message type, to let clients reorder their
    indices without having to delete and reupload the associated data nodes.

v1.92 - Released 11/23/01
  - PortableHashtables now retain the ordering of the items you Put() into them.
    (And since PortableMessage uses a PortableHashtable internally, this means
     also that PortableMessage now retains the ordering of the data fields you
     add to it)
  - Added MoveToFront(), MoveToBack(), MoveToBefore(), and MoveToBehind()
    methods to the PortableHashtable class.  These methods allow the user
    to modify the iteration traversal order.
  - It is now possible to modify a PortableHashtable in the middle of
    traversing its contents with a PortableHashtableIterator, without causing
    an assertion failure or even messing up the traversal(!).
  - Renamed PortableHashtable::Contains() to ContainsValue(), to avoid
    confusion.
  - Rewrote PortableHashtableFieldNameIterator to be simpler and more efficient.
  - Rewrote ReflectServer to use only a PortableHashtable to hold
    AbstractReflectSessionRefs, instead of both a PortableHashtable and a
    PortableQueue.
  - Renamed ReflectServer::GetSessionsList() and
    AbstractReflectSession::GetSessionsList() to GetSessions(), which now
    returns a hashtable iterator instead of a reference to a PortableQueue.
  - Renamed ReflectServer::GetSessionByID() and
    AbstractReflectSession::GetSessionByID() to GetSession(), which now
    returns an AbstractReflectSessionRef instead of a status_t.
  - Added a +(char) operator to PortableString class.
  - Made the non-session-specific server API access methods in
    AbstractReflectSession protected, instead of public.
  - Added a SwapContents() method to the PortableHashtable class.
  * Fixed the GrowTable() method -- the user compare function wasn't
    being retained.

v1.91 - Released 11/01/01
  - Added atomic inc/decs for Linux and Windows into PortableRefCount.h
  - The admin tool now waits for a response from the server, and informs you
    if your admin commands failed due to a privilege violation.
  - Changed GetPeerInfo() to try and find out what the local host's "real"
    IP address is if necessary, instead of returning 127.0.0.1.
  - moved the signal(SIGHUP, SIG_IGN) code into InitializeTCPStack().
  * Integrated Vitaliy's patches to get QMessageTransceiverThread to work
    under Windows.

v1.90 - Released 10/26/01
  - Changed the PortableRefCount class to require that the items it
    reference-counts are subclasses of PortableRefCountable.  This has the
    advantage of removing all the RefCountMem and RefCountMemPool dependencies;
    unfortunately it also breaks most of the MUSCLE-using code out there
    (slightly).  The old PortableRefCount implementation is now called
    UnintrusivePortableRefCount, and is left in for use in cases where the
    reference-counted class cannot be modified to derive from
    PortableRefCountable.
  - Added a StorageReflectSession::CloneDataNodeSubtree() convenience method.
  - Added a CreateAcceptingSocket() function to NetworkUtilityFunctions.  This
    function creates and returns a socket that is listening for incoming TCP
    connections on the given port.
  - Added a Flush() callback method to the LogCallback class, and a LogFlush()
    global function, so that SysLog output can be fflush()'d in a generic
    manner.
  - Added support for defining a custom threadsafe incrementor function in
    PortableRefCount.h
  - Added #define PR_NAME_SESSION "session" into StorageReflectConstants.
    Now when muscled sees a string with this field name in a client-to-client
    PortableMessage, it will replace the string value with the sending client's
    session ID.  This allows receiving clients to be sure that the client who
    sent them the message is the client indicated in the server field of the
    message (i.e. it disallows "spoofing" of other clients).
  - Added an example flattened-PortableMessage byte listing to the end of
    PortableMessageIOGateway.h
  - Added AddHead() and AddTail() methods to PortableQueue that take
    other PortableQueues, rather than individual items.
  - QMessageTransceiverThread::PortableMessageReceived()'s second argument
    is now a uint32 instead of an int.
  - Added the InitializeTCPStack() function to NetworkUtilityFunctions.h
    (Starts up the TCP stack;  only needed under Windows)
  - Added handy factory functions for the PortableMessageIOGateway and
    PlainTextMessageIOGateway classes.
  - Added the LogLineCallback convenience subclass to SysLog.{cpp,h}
  - Added Vitaliy's vc++ subfolder with VC++ project files.
  * More windows compatibility tweaks; muscled now compiles and runs under
    Windows XP with VC++! (many thanks to Vitaliy Mikitchenko aka VitViper!)
  * StorageReflectSession::NodePathMatcher::DoTraversal() was not giving
    correct results for traversals that used multiple query strings and
    didn't start from the global database root.  Fixed.

v1.84 - Released 10/15/01
  - Added a SpawnDaemonProcess() function to NetworkUtilityFunctions.h
  - Added a Snooze64() function to NetworkUtilityFunctions.h
  - Added ReleaseFile() and GetFile() methods to FileDataIO.h
  - Added a PR_NAME_SET_QUIETLY tag so you can upload nodes to
    the database without causing subscribers to be notified.
  - Added a PR_NAME_REMOVE_QUIETLY tag so you can remove nodes from
    the database without causing subscribers to be notified.
  - Added Jonathon Padfield's QSocketDataIO class to the qtsupport
    folder (for single-threaded Qt programs).  Thanks, Jonathan!
  - Added a MCHECKPOINT macro to PortableMacros.h for use in debugging.
  - Added a RemoveAllInstancesOf(const ItemType &) method to the
    PortableQueue class.
  - Added == and != operators to the PortableQueue class.
  - testgateway.cpp now takes optional filename arguments.  Any
    filenames given to it will be read as flattened PortableMessages
    and their contents printed to stdout.
  - Added a OnceEvery(uint64, uint64 &) function to TimeUtilityFunctions.h
  - PortableMessage::PrintToStream() now has optional arguments to make
    it function recursively with varying levels of indentation.
  - Added a new class regex/PathMatcher.{cpp,h} to the repertoire.
    This class can be used to do efficient pattern matching against
    node-path strings.  Moved the functions in
    reflector/StorageReflectUtils.{cpp,h} into these files instead.
  - Previously subscribing to a string you were already subscribed to
    was a no-op.  Now it is equivalent to a PR_COMMAND_GETDATA using
    that string.
  - PortableQueue::Sort() now takes an optional void pointer that will
    be passed through to the item-compare callback function.
  * Jonathon Padfield contributed a patch to PortableByteOrder.h to
    make it compile under FreeBSD.  Thanks again J  :^)
  * PortableRef class now has a proper copy-constructor.
  * Changed B_ERROR and B_NO_ERROR declarations from an enumeration
    to #defines, to avoid compiler warnings.
  * Fixed a bug in QMessageTransceiverThread that would cause
    TCP connections to be broken as soon as they were connected.
  * TCPSocketDataIO::Shutdown() now calls shutdown() before close().
    (Linux wasn't being properly punctual with just close())
  * PortableString::Unflatten() now checks to make sure the
    flattened string is terminated, and errors out if it isn't.
  * PortableHashtable::Put()'s default value for the last argument
    was false instead of NULL.  Fixed.
  * Made several methods in StorageReflectSession inline and const tagged.

v1.83 - Released 9/12/01
  - Added a qtsupport folder, containing QMessageTransceiverThread
    and QThreadSafeObjectPool classes for use with the Qt API.
  - Added more of David Rene's Visual C++ compatibility changes in.
  - Renamed GetCurrentTime() to GetCurrentTime64() to avoid a
    conflict with the like-named Windows function, and added
    David's Win32 implementation of the method.
  - Added MUSCLE_CLASS_DECLARATIONS and MUSCLE_FUNCTION_DECLARATIONS
    tokens into the header files where appropriate.  These tokens
    are #defined to nothing by default, but can be overridden by the
    compile environment (-D flag) if necessary.
  - Added an "okayToAdd" argument to all the Replace*() methods
    in the PortableMessage class; if set to true, then attempting
    to replace a non-existing item will cause the new item
    to be added to the message instead of returning B_NO_ERROR.
    If set false, the old behaviour (fail if old item not present)
    is used instead.
  - Added a Reset() method to the MessageTransceiverThread classes.
    You can call Reset() on a MessageTransceiverThread object to
    re-initialize its state (comparable to deleting the
    MessageTransceiverThread object and creating a new one)
  - Added GetOutputStallLimit() methods to the AbstractMessageIOGateway,
    PortableDataIO, and TCPSocketDataIO classes.  Now output stall
    detection is only done on TCP connections, and can be controlled
    per gateway or per data io type.
  - Changed the ReflectServer to take a ReflectSessionFactory object
    in PutAcceptPort() instead of a callback function.  Converted all session
    creation callback functions into ReflectSessionFactory subclasses.
  - Added an overloaded () operator to the StringTokenizer class, as
    a convenience.  It works as a synonym for GetNextToken().

v1.82 - Released 8/21/01
  - During a memory shortage, muscled now kicks users whose output
    message queues have grown too large.  This keeps someone with
    a bad network connection and an ambitious subscription request
    from tying up all the memory on the server indefinitely.
  - Changed the signature of AbstractMessageIOGateway::DoInput() and
    AbstractMessageIOGateway::DoOutput() to DoInput(uint32 & addReadBytes)
    and DoOutput(uint32 & addWroteBytes).  DoInput() and DoOutput()
    should add to this argument the number of bytes they read or
    wrote during the call, respectively.  This helps the calling
    code know when I/O is stalled.
  - muscled now keeps track of how long an output has been "stalled"
    (i.e. it has bytes queued to send to the client but none have
    actually been sent) and will drop any clients that have been
    stalled for more than 20 minutes.

v1.81 - Released 7/16/01
  - Added Alan's stream operators ("<<") to the PortableString class.
  * Made AtheOS refcounts use atomic_add(), for thread safety.
  * Merged in David Rene's header tweaks to help MUSCLE code compile
    cleanly under Visual C++.
  * Tweaked time.h includes to compile properly under Debian Linux.
  * Messages being returned to the global message pool now have
    their 'what' code set to zero.
  * Fixed a potential source of problems during out-of-memory
    conditions in the PortableMessageIOGateway class.

v1.80 - Released 6/26/01
  - Added an atheossupport directory, which is a AtheOS port of
    the BeOS code in the besupport directory.
  - Added testatheosclient.cpp and testatheossupport.cpp testing
    stubs to the test folder.
  * Consolidated the netutil, string, stringtokenizer, hashtable,
    refcount, pool, and queue subfolders into a single subfolder
    named 'util'.  All code that uses MUSCLE will probably need
    to have its #include lines modified to reflect this, before
    it will compile again.  :^(  (this change was necessary in
    order to avoid #include space conflicts with the STL headers)

v1.72 - Released 6/22/01
  - Added a "maxnodespersession" parameter to muscled, which lets
    you specify the maximum number of nodes any given session may
    have in its server-side database at one time.
  - Added a uint32 PR_NAME_MAX_NODES_PER_SESSION read-only parameter
    to the parameter set returned by PR_COMMAND_GET_PARAMETERS.
    This returns the value mentioned above.
  - Made some of the members of the DataNode class demand-allocated,
    so as to use a little less memory.
  - Tweaked the code to compile without errors under the CygWin environment.
    (thanks to Joshua Schmiedlin for his help with this)
  - Added a Sort() method to the PortableQueue class.  This method
    uses a nice in-place merge-sort algorithm that I liberated from
    Thomas Baudel's sorting visualizer applet at
    http://www-ihm.lri.fr/~thomas/VisuTri/
  - Added Swap() and ReverseItemOrdering() methods to PortableQueue.
    These let you swap two entries or a invert the ordering of a
    whole range of entries, respectively.
  - ReflectServer now preallocates 256 slots for the lame-duck session
    list, so that adding a session to the lest is less likely to fail
    during a memory pinch.
  - Added a SetNotificationMessage() method to MessageTransceiverThread
    class (in case the regular old PORTABLE_MESSAGES_RECEIVED message
    isn't good enough for you)

v1.71 - Released 6/11/01
  - Renamed ReflectServer::AddAcceptPort() to PutAcceptPort().
    Changed ReflectServer to allocate accept-sockets inside the
    PutAcceptPort() call instead of at the beginning of the
    ServerEventLoop().  Also added a RemoveAcceptPort() method to
    ReflectServer, and added PutAcceptPort() and RemoveAcceptPort()
    pass-through methods to AbstractReflectSession.
  - Added a BroadcastToAllNeighbors() convenience method to
    the AbstractReflectSession class.
  - Added a Seek() method to the PortableDataIO interface, and
    Seek() implementations to the various subclasses thereof.
    Moved FileDescriptorDataIO's implementation into a .cpp file
    so that it will link properly under Linux.
  * Added some missing constants to StorageReflectSession.java

v1.70 - Released 5/20/01
  - Changed the Makefiles to reflect the changed, final location
    of the BONE headers (/boot/develop/headers/be/bone)
  - Changed the Put() methods of PortableHashtable to return
    true on success, false on error (memory allocation failure).
    NOTE:  This changes the Put()'s return value semantics!
    If you code was relying on them, you will need to modify it.
  - Changed ReflectServer::ServerProcessLoop() to take no arguments,
    and added a method ReflectServer::AddAcceptPort(func, port) instead.
    This change allows a single server to accept connections on multiple
    ports if it wants to, and create different AbstractReflectSession objects
    based on the port the TCP connection was received on.  As a consequence
    of this, you can now have muscled listen on multiple ports if you like;
    e.g. muscled port=2960 port=4000 port=9999
  - Added a GetServerUptime() method to the ReflectServer and
    AbstractReflectSession classes, and a PR_NAME_SERVER_UPTIME
    field to the message returned by PR_COMMAND_GET_PARAMETERS.
    The value returned is muscled's uptime, in microseconds.
  * Changed the AddLogCallback() and AddOutOfMemoryHandler() functions
    to return B_ERROR on out-of-memory.
  * Changed the muscled code to handle Put() failing a little better.
    This should fix some of the memory leaks that occur when the server
    has hit its memory cap.

v1.64 - Released 5/07/01
  - Added dataio/MemoryBufferDataIO.h.  This class lets you use
    an in-memory array as a limited input or output device.
  - Added a new first parameter to BecomeDaemonProcess().  This
    first param lets you specify the directory that the child
    process should chdir() to.  Leave as NULL to not change directory at all.
  - Added a GetReadByteTimeStamp() method to the PortableDataIO
    interface.  (used to support high-precision time-stamping in LCS-specific
    subclasses.   Not implemented by any of the included MUSCLE classes, though)
  - Added a PR_COMMAND_BATCH message type.  When the server receives
    this message, it will parse the submessages in the PR_NAME_KEYS
    field and execute them in order as if they had arrived separately.
  - Added a PR_COMMAND_NOOP message types.  When the server receives
    this message it is guaranteed to do nothing at all with it.
  - In the StorageReflectSession class, changed NotifySubscribersOfNewNode(),
    NotifySubscribersThatNodeChanged(), and
    NotifySubscribersThatNodeIndexChanged() to be virtual so that they can be
    overridden and used as hooks in a subclass.
  - Added a CreateConnectedSocketPair() function to the
    NetworkUtilityFunctions.h package.  This function is useful
    for thread coordination.
  - Added a SetSocketBlockingEnabled() function to NetworkUtilityFunctions.h
  - muscled now compiles and runs under AtheOS, thanks to a
    patch submitted by Jonas Sundstrom.
  * The docs were referring to the muscled's pattern matching
    feature as 'regular expressions'.  This was inaccurate, as
    muscled doesn't parse regular expressions so much as wildcard
    expressions, a.k.a. globbing.  Changed the docs to reflect this.
  * PortableString::LastIndexOf(char) was broken.  Fixed.
  * Boolean PortableMessage fields were broken on architectures
    where sizeof(bool) was not equal to one.  Fixed.

v1.63 - Released 3/25/01
  - iogateway/PlainTextMessageIOGateway.cpp now works.  While not
    used by muscled, this class can be used by other programs for
    easy communication with servers that speak ASCII text (e.g.
    web servers, XML server, e-commerce servers, etc).  See
    PlainTextMessageIOGateway.h for details.
  - Added test/plaintextclient.cpp and test/portableplaintext.cpp.
    These are command line communications test programs, similar
    to testreflectlient.cpp and portablereflectclient.cpp, respectively,
    but using plain text streams rather than flattened PortableMessages.
  - Added a Shutdown() method to the PortableDataIO classes.  This
    method can be used to immediately close the underlying socket/file
    descriptor/whatever, without having to delete the PortableDataIO object.
  - Made AbstractMessageIOGateway::GetDataIO() public.
  - BecomeDaemonProcess() now takes two optional arguments:  the
    first indicates where to redirect stderr and stdout to.  Default
    value is "/dev/null".  The second indicates whether or not to
    try and create a file if it can't be opened; default is false.
  * When the MessageTransceiverThread gets an I/O error, it now closes
    its connection immediately (by calling GetDataIO()->Shutdown())
    rather than waiting for the user to do it.
  * The muscled ServerProcessLoop() and MessageTransceiverThread now
    both suppress SIGPIPE signals, as these can be raised when sending
    to a remotely-closed socket, killing the thread.

v1.62 - Released 3/2/01
  - Added a PR_NAME_SERVER_VERSION parameter to the parameter set
    returned by the server.  This field contains a string to indicate
    the version of MUSCLE the muscled server was compiled from.
    (Currently the string is "1.62")
  * Several parameter name constants were missing from
    StorageReflectConstants.java.  Added.
  * The clever byte-swapping macros put in for MacOS/X were screwing
    up the byte-ordering for Linux, so I removed them.
  * PortableMessage.java had a call to Vector.add() in it.  Changed it to
    Vector.addElement().
  * Made the _empty Hashtable in PortableMessage.java demand allocated,
    otherwise IE would barf on it.

v1.61 - Released 2/16/01
  - Changed the Pulse()/GetPulseTime() callbacks to use uint64s instead of
    timeval structs--uint64's are much easier to use than timevals.
  - Added a BecomeDaemonProcess() function to NetworkUtilityFunctions.h
    This function calls fork() and all the other incantations necessary to
    convert the current process into a canonical Posix daemon task.
  - muscled now recognizes the parameter 'daemon'.  If specified, muscled
    will detach from the shell and run as a background/daemon task.
  * muscled now parses keywords even if they have no '=' sign/value specified.
  * Changed the SysLog implementation to use separate callbacks for console
    and file logging.  Before it was using the same callback for both, but
    certain versions of Linux crash if I try to re-use a va_list object.

v1.60 - Released 2/1/01
  - Added Java client support to MUSCLE!  (See README-JAVA.txt)
  - Changed header comments to JavaDoc style throughout.
  - Added extra commenting to a lot of previously uncommented header code.
    Now all public and protected methods and member items are documented.
  - The muscle/html/autodoc/genDocs.sh script now calls doxygen instead
    of PERCEPS.  Doxygen is a very nice autodocumenting program, and a
    BeOS port can be found on BeBits.
  - Added a muscle.dox config file to the muscle/html/autodoc directory.
  - Added a () operator to the PortableString class so you can say
    myString(), instead of myString.Cstr(), if you want.
  - PortableString methods StartsWith, EndsWith(), EndsWithIgnoreCase(),
    and StartsWithIgnoreCase() now return bool instead of int.
  - The PR_RESULT_PARAMETERS messages returned by the server now include
    uint64 PR_NAME_SERVER_MEM_AVAILABLE, PR_NAME_SERVER_MEM_USED, and
    PR_NAME_SERVER_MEM_MAX fields that indicates how much
    memory the server has available to be allocated by all MUSCLE clients.
  - Added a FileDescriptorDataIO class to the dataio directory.  This
    dataio supports sessions that want to do read() and write() on a
    file descriptor for their I/O.
  * AddFlat(), PrependFlat(), ReplaceFlat(), and FindFlat() will
    now call their Point, String, or Message counterparts if they
    are passed a PortablePoint, PortableString, or PortableMessage object.
  * Flattened objects added to a PortableMessage are now filed using
    the field type returned by their TypeCode() member, rather than
    always as B_OBJECT_TYPE.  This will break compatibility with old
    clients that expected B_OBJECT_TYPE flattened objects; sorry about that.
  * Added in some extra tweaks so that MUSCLE will compile under MacOS/X.
  * A bunch of member variables of the AbstractMessageIOGateway class
    were protected when they should have been private.  Changed them
    to private and added protected accessor methods where necessary.
  * HTML-ized the README.TXT file (now named README.html)

v1.51 - Released 1/3/01
  - Added PR_COMMAND_KICK, PR_COMMAND_ADDBANS, and PR_COMMAND_REMOVEBANS
    commands.  Messages of these types instruct the muscle server to
    disconnect other clients, forbid IP addresses from connecting to
    the server, and remove previously added bans, respectively.
    These messages will only be honored if sent by a privileged
    client; otherwise a PR_RESULT_ERRORACCESSDENIED message is returned.
  - muscled now takes "privban=<pattern>", "privunban=<pattern>",
    "privkick=<pattern>", and "privall=<pattern>" arguments, to
    specify which clients are allowed to do kick, ban, or unban ops.
    (if not specified, no clients will be privileged)
  - Added an 'admin' command-line tool to the muscle/server
    directory that lets you manage your server's ban lists
    and/or kick users without having to restart the server.
    Run 'admin help' for args.
  - Made ReflectServer::GetCentralState() public.
  * Removed the ClientConnected() and SetClientConnected()
    callbacks in favor of a more elegant StorageReflectSession
    oriented privileges system.  The new system allows the server
    operator to specify which clients are allowed to kick, ban,
    and unban other clients.

v1.50 - Released 12/29/00
  - Loosened up the flattened-PortableMessage protocol specification
    a little bit.  It is now legal to add fields with arbitrary typecodes
    to a PortableMessage, and PortableMessages with fields that have
    arbitrary typecodes may be Unflatten()'d without causing an error.
    This will allow the addition and use of new datatypes without breaking
    backwards compatibility, thus avoiding a repeat of the problems that
    were caused by adding the B_MIME_TYPE support.
  - support/PortableMacros.h now contains a MUSCLE_VERSION_STRING
    #define, indicating the current version of MUSCLE.  muscled
    will print this version string out on startup if you set
    the display threshold to DEBUG or lower.
  * Tweaked StorageReflectSession.{cpp,h} to get it to compile under
    Red Hat Linux 7.0.

v1.45 - Released 12/22/00
  - Added a GetPeerInfo() function into NetworkUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}.
    This function returns the remote host IP and port of a connected socket.
  - Added a ClientConnected() virtual method and
    SetClientConnectedCallbackFunc() method to ReflectServer.  Both of these
    mechanisms allow connecting clients to be checked before allowing them
    access to the server.
  - muscled can now accept zero or more ban=<ipaddr> arguments on the command
    line.  Each ban argument specifies an IP address (or wildcard pattern of
    IP addresses) to ban from the server.
  - Added EndServer() methods to the ReflectServer and AbstractReflectSession
    classes.  These allow you to cause muscled to exit in a controlled manner.
  - You can now disable the memory-usage-tracking overloads of new and
    delete by defining the preprocessor symbol DISABLE_MUSCLE_MEMORY_TRACKING
    for ReflectServer.cpp.
  - muscled's Makefile now supports both optimized and unoptimized builds
    of muscled.  Do "make" for an unoptimized build, or "make optimized"
    for an optimized build.  (Be sure to "make clean" first when switching
    from one to the other!)
  * Fixed a couple of memory leaks in the PortableHashtable class.
  * Rewrote PortableHashtable::GrowTable() to handle out-of-memory
    conditions correctly.
  * Removed the WATCH_MUSCLE_MEMORY_USAGE macros, since the overloaded
    new and delete operators do the same thing in a more elegant way.
  * Updated the docs slightly to reflect the fact that level one
    server-database nodes are named after the clients' IP addresses,
    not their hostnames.
  * Fixed an uninitialized-pointer problem that could make muscled
    crash while denying a login.

v1.44 - Released 12/21/00
  - Modified PortableHashtable to maintain a linked list of
    PortableHashtableEntry objects.  This should speed up traversals
    somewhat, as the PortableHashtableIterator no longer needs to
    iterate over the empty portions of the table.
  - Merged in Trey Boudreau's changes to support adding fields of
    type B_MIME_TYPE to a PortableMessage.
  - Added IndexOfIgnoreCase() and LastIndexOfIgnoreCase() methods
    to PortableString that take chars instead of (const char *)'s
    as their second argument.

v1.43 - Released 12/01/00
  - Added a "Custom Servers.html" file to muscle/html.  This file contains
    information on making your own custom MUSCLE server.
  - Changed ObjectPool to reuse items in LIFO order rather than FIFO.
    This may increase cache coherency in some cases.
  - Makefile now compiles muscled with -O3 and -fomit-frame-pointer options
    under gcc, for efficiency.
  - Added SetMessageFlattenCallback() and SetMessageUnflattenCallback()
    methods to the PortableMessageIOGateway class (for when you can't be
    bothered to do proper subclassing ;^))
  - Added ParseLogLevelToken() function to SysLog.h, and added 'display'
    and 'log' arguments to muscled, so that you can specify how what sort
    of output you want on the command line.
    (e.g. "./muscled display=debug log=none")
  - Added more *IgnoreCase() methods to PortableString, and changed
    PortableString::Equals() to return a bool instead of an int.
  - Pulled the timeval utility functions out of NetworkUtilityFunctions.{cpp,h}
    and into their own file, netutil/TimeUtilityFunctions.h
    Also declared them all inline, so you don't need to link anything
    extra in to use them.
  - Moved references to <sys/time.h> into PortableTypeDefs.h, and added
    a #include there so that including this header can be avoided.
    (This is to support certain embedded architectures which don't
    seem have this file...)
  - Added a operator() overload to the PortableRefCount(), so you can
    now specify myRef() instead of myRef.GetItemPointer().
  * Renamed the LOG_* constants in SysLog.h to MUSCLE_LOG_*, to avoid
    conflicts with the constants in Be's support/syslog.h header.  (This
    may break some existing code, sorry about that)
  * Disabled the memory-allocation code under BeOS/PowerPC environments,
    as it was causing mysterious crashes (possible compiler bug?).  This
    means that if you are running muscled on a PowerPC BeOS machine, the
    memory allocation limits will be ignored.

v1.42 - Released 10/18/00
  - Added a new function, AddOutOfMemoryHandler((void *)()).  This lets you
    install your own handler that will be called in the event of a memory
    allocation failure.
  - Added a new command code, PR_COMMAND_PING.  When muscled receives a message
    of this type from its client, changes the message's 'what' code to
    PR_RESULT_PONG, and sends the message right back to the client.
  - Added a GetRemainderOfString() method to the StringTokenizer class.
  * Moved the StorageReflectSession::DrainPools() call out of ReflectServer.cpp,
    and into a callback that is installed by muscled.cpp.  This allows custom
    servers to be compiled without having to link in StorageReflectSession.o.
  * The memory-tracking new and delete operators now count their own
    4-byte-per-allocation overhead in the allocated-memory total.

v1.41 - Released 10/8/00
  - Added a FindDataPointer() method to the PortableMessage class.
    This method returns a writable pointer to a field's data
    array, for efficiency.
  - PortableMessage::AddData() now allows the (data) parameter to
    be NULL.  If (data) is NULL, default-constructed objects or
    uninitialized data bytes will be added to the PortableMessage.
  - PortableMessage::FindData() and FindDataPointer() now allow
    the (numBytes) parameter to be NULL.
  - muscled now parses command line arguments of the form
    keyword=value.  Currently supported keywords are 'port',
    'help', and 'maxmem'.
  - muscled now detects out-of-memory situations and tries to free up
    some memory by draining the object pools and/or forcibly
    disconnecting the active session when an out-of-memory error occurs.
  - muscled now lets you specify the maximum number of bytes of
    data it should allow itself to have allocated at any one time.
    For example, entering "muscled maxmem=15" will cause muscled
    to not help itself to more than 15 megabytes of memory.
  * Went through the code and made it more resistant to crashing
    in out-of-memory situations.  (i.e. it should correctly handle
    NULL being returned by new (nothrow) in all cases)
  * Fixed a bug that would cause muscled to crash if it was
    sent a malformed PortableMessage.  Thanks to Ben and Pete
    for helping me find this bug!
  * Now compiles cleanly with full warnings enabled, thanks
    to Christopher Tate.

v1.40 - Released 9/8/00
  - Added ordered-child-indexing to StorageReflectSession.  Support
    for this includes the new PR_COMMAND_INSERTORDEREDDATA code,
    the PR_RESULT_INDEXUPDATED result code, and the INDEX_OP_*
    enums.  (see comments in StorageReflectConstants.h and the new
    chapter at the end of the Beginner's Guide for details)
  - Added Prepend*() methods to the PortableMessage class.
  - PortableQueue and PortableString can now handle very small
    strings/lists without having to do any dynamic memory allocation.
  - Added Head(), Tail(), HeadPointer(), TailPointer(), and
    InsertItemAt() to PortableQueue.

v1.31 - Released 7/30/00
  - Added custom-callback capability to the SysLog module.
    (AddLogCallback(), RemoveLogCallback())
  - Added the OnceEvery() function to NetworkUtilityFunctions.
  * Fixed an uninitialized timeval struct in AbstractMessageIOGateway--
    this was causing muscled to panic and exit sometimes under FreeBSD.
    (Thanks to Peter Schultz for helping track down this bug!)

v1.30 - Released 6/30/00
  - Added optional object-allocation tracking into the code.
    This tracking is useful for hunting down memory leaks;  to enable it
    uncomment the -DMUSCLE_WATCH_MEM_USAGE line in the Makefile and
    recompile the server (from scratch).  With this flag enabled,
    the server will print out memory-allocation stats every so many
    seconds.
  - Added some PR_COMMAND_RESERVED and PR_RESULT_RESERVED constants
    to StorageReflectConstants.h to allow future expansion.
  - Added a PR_RESULT_ERRORUNIMPLEMENTED code.  This message is
    sent back to the client when the client sends a PR_COMMAND_RESERVED
    code that the serverd doesn't understand.
  - Added a PR_COMMAND_JETTISONRESULTS command.  When the server receives
    a message of this type, it will match the paths given in PR_NAME_KEYS
    against the items in its list of outgoing PR_RESULTS_DATAITEMS messages,
    and any matched items will be deleted and not sent.  If no PR_NAME_KEYS
    field is found in the PR_COMMAND_JETTISONRESULTS message, then all
    pending PR_RESULTS_DATAITEMS messages will be dumped.  (This is useful
    when a client is receiving a large result set and decides in the middle
    of the download that he's no longer interested in it)
  - muscled no longer does a hostname lookup when a client logs in.
    This speeds up muscled's response time (and frees it from depending
    on a working nameserver) but it means that nodes in level one
    of the database tree will look like '127.0.0.1' instead of
    'mycomputer.mydomain.com'.
  - Added ClientConnectionClosed() callback to the AbstractReflectSession
    class, so that a session can decide whether it wants to stick around
    after its TCP connection is gone.
  - Replaced the AbstractReflectSession class's GetIncomingMessageQueue()
    and GetOutgoingMessageQueue() methods with the more flexible
    GetGateway() and SetGateway() methods.
  - Added some utility functions to StringMatcher.{cpp,h}:
    IsRegexToken(), HasRegexTokens(), and MakeRegexCaseInsensitive().
  - Now compiles under FreeBSD4.0, using gmake.
  * The StringMatcher wasn't handling parentheses properly.  Fixed it,
    so now you can use expressions like *.(jpg,mp?).  Also rewrote the
    regex translation code to be more readable, and fixed a nasty
    dangling-pointer bug in the process.
  * Changed the RefCountMem class to use atomic_add instead of the
    C preincrement and predecrement operators, so that it can be used
    safely in multithreaded environments.
  * Fixed a subtle bug in the Remove*() methods of the PortableQueue
    class that could cause crashes if you were removing items whose
    assignment operators looked at the PortableQueue they were
    being removed from...  geez
  * Added some missing virtual destructors
  * Rewrote the PortableString class to be more efficient, and
    in the process found and fixed a nasty bug--the CStringHashFunc()
    was completely broken.
  * StringMatcher::Match() is now tagged as const.

v1.24 - 6/17/00
  - muscled now splits its PR_RESULT_DATAITEMS messages into multiple
    messages if the message has more than 50 items in it.  This allows
    for more fine-grained updates.
  - Added a PR_NAME_MAX_UPDATE_MESSAGE_ITEMS parameter that can
    be set by the client to change the above threshold if desired.

v1.23 - 6/15/00
  - Added a StartServerThread() method to the MessageTransceiverThread
    class.  Now the MessageTransceiverThread can be used to accept
    multiple overlapping connections, instead of just a series of
    single connections.
  * make clean now removes .xSYM files.

v1.22 - 6/14/00
  * MessageTransceiverThread::WaitForAllMessagesToBeSent() was broken.
    Changed it to use benaphores instead of BLockers, and now all is well.

v1.21 - 6/12/00
  - Added Prepend() and Append() methods to PortableString.
  - Added InetNtoA() convenience method to NetworkUtilityFunctions.cpp
  - Added EscapeRegexTokens() to StorageReflectUtils.h
  * User messages would be reflected back to the sender even when
    the reflect-to-self flag wasn't set.  Fixed.
  * Fixed several bugs in the MessageTransceiverThread class.
  * muscled now handles connections from localhost correctly.

v1.20 - 6/8/00
  - Added new accessors to PortableHashtable and PortableMessage that
    return key and value objects by pointer rather than by value.
    This can make access and traversals more efficient, as it eliminates
    an unnecessary data copy.
  - Added default constructors to the PortableHashtableIterator and
    PortableMessageFieldNameIterator classes so that you can use
    them in arrays, as class members, etc.
  - Added SetOutgoingQueueDrainedMessage() to the MessageTransceiverThread
    API so that you can (optionally) receive notification when the outgoing
    message queue has become empty.
  * Made ObjectPool's destructor virtual.

v1.10 - 6/1/00
  - Added ReplaceSession() method, by which a server-side session object
    can replace itself with a different one.
  - AbstractMessageIOGateway objects can now request Pulse() callbacks.
  - Added system logging, to the console or to a log file, or both.
  * Fixed some minor compilation problems

v1.01 - 4/11/00
  o Redesigned the Pulse() support to work based on absolute wakeup times
    rather than relative periods.
  - Added some convenience methods for working with timeval structs to
    NetworkUtilityFunctios.h

v1.00 - 3/29/00
  - Initial release
