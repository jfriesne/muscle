# muscle::FileDataIO class [(API)](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1FileDataIO.html)

```#include "dataio/FileDataIO.h"```

[FileDataIO](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1FileDataIO.html) is used to read/write data from a standard C file-handle (`FILE *`, as returned by `fopen()`).

* The [FileDataIO](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1FileDataIO.html) object will assume ownership of the `FILE *` handle you pass in to it, so don't need to (and shouldn't) call `fclose()` on it yourself.
* If you'd prefer to defer opening the file until you actually need to access it, [FileDataIO](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1FileDataIO.html) also has a constructor that simply takes the arguments to pass to `fopen()` and will call `fopen()` the first time it tries to access the file.
