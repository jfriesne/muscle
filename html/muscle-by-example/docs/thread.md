```#include "system/Thread.h"```

MUSCLE's Thread class

* A [Thread](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Thread.html) object holds a captive internal thread, plus two low-latency/zero-copy [FIFO MessageRef queues](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Queue.html) (one for the main/owning thread to send command [Message](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Message.html) objects to the internal thread, and a second one for the internal thread to send reply [Message](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Message.html) objects back to the main/owning thread)
* Similar to:  [std::thread](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread), [pthread_create()](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_create.3.html), [QThread](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qthread.html), [_beginthreadex](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kdzttdcb.aspx)
* When compiled with C++11, [Thread](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Thread.html) is implemented via `std::thread`.  Otherwise, it will be implemented using an appropriate threading API (i.e. `pthreads` or an OS-specific API).
* Call [StartInternalThread()](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Thread.html#a2034e7c4c6e91ecbbf1d43a2c2c2afb1) to start the internal thread running
* Call [ShutdownInternalThread()](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Thread.html#acf36378b1d8024e00be15be50036f32a) to tell the internal thread to go away ([ShutdownInternalThread()](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Thread.html#acf36378b1d8024e00be15be50036f32a) will, by default, wait until the thread exits before returning)
* Call [WaitForInternalThreadToExit()](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Thread.html#a9d775da500b05b6884eceb520d05359c) to block until the internal thread has exited (similar to `pthread_join`) (only necessary if you passed `false` as an argument to [ShutdownInternalThread()](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Thread.html#acf36378b1d8024e00be15be50036f32a), of course)
* Call [SendMessageToInternalThread()](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Thread.html#aa75adae3979a16d20ace55ab6b801ff2) to (asynchronously) send a command Message to the internal thread, i.e. to tell it to wake up and to do something
* Call [GetNextReplyFromInternalThread()](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Thread.html#a571cab4216d7906963c0e401318f86e0) to receive a reply Message back from the internal thread (the call's second argument can be used to block waiting for the [Message](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Message.html), if desired)
* The [ConstSocketRef](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1ConstSocketRef.html) returned by [GetOwnerWakeupSocket()](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Thread.html#ae2fa9475add52a0314539418d71bc04c) can be used by the main thread (in conjunction with `select()`/[SignalMultiplexer](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1SignalMultiplexer.html) (etc)) as a way to wake up when the next reply [Message](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Message.html) is available from the internal thread.
* The default implementation of [Thread::InternalThreadEntry()](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Thread.html#a570ca57b018b0ba3528aaa0686d71620) runs a while-loop around calls to [WaitForNextMessageFromOwner()](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Thread.html#ab165fef7c04d2d15bdce9069eff32bc5) and [MessageReceivedFromOwner()](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Thread.html#ae6769ac118df33a1cbdd71cb77a1d795), so if you just need the internal thread to react to [Message](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Message.html) commands you send it, you need only override the [Thread::MessageReceivedFromOwner()](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Thread.html#ae6769ac118df33a1cbdd71cb77a1d795) callback method.
* If you need to write your own custom event-loop for the internal thread, you are free to override [Thread::InternalThreadEntry()](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Thread.html#a570ca57b018b0ba3528aaa0686d71620) to do whatever you need the internal thread to do.
* Note that [ShutdownInternalThread()](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Thread.html#acf36378b1d8024e00be15be50036f32a) will signal the internal thread that it is time to exit by calling `SendMessageToInternalThread(MessageRef())` -- that is, by sending a NULL [MessageRef](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Message.html) to the internal thread.
* Thread priority can be set via [SetThreadPriority()](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Thread.html#a991dc262c131bce08a4b1fa82b93f049)
* Thread stack size can be set via [SetSuggestedStackSize()](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Thread.html#a7e07944719472c44a0c20f275e06761e) (must be done before calling [StartInternalThread()](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Thread.html#a2034e7c4c6e91ecbbf1d43a2c2c2afb1))
