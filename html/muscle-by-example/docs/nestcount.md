# muscle::NestCount class [(API)](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1NestCount.html)

```#include "util/NestCount.h"```

The [NestCount](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1NestCount.html) class is a simple recursion-safe RAII counter mechanism for tracking a program's execution-state within a call tree.

* A [NestCount](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1NestCount.html) object is typically declared as a member variable in a class, and a [NestCountGuard](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1NestCountGuard.html) object is declared at the top of a (potentially) recursive/re-entrant method in that class.
* Once that is done, the [NestCount](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1NestCount.html)'s [IsInBatch()](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1NestCount.html#a6a0885cb931bc04b3634daf8e23dc977) method can be called at any time to find out if any [NestCountGuard](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1NestCountGuard.html)s referencing that [NestCount](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1NestCount.html) are currently on the thread's stack.
