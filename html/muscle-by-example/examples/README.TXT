This folder contains the "toy example" programs for the "MUSCLE by Example" self-guided tour.

To compile them, you can either compile them all at once by typing "make" while in this folder,
or you can cd to the individual sub-directory you are interested in and enter "make" from there,
if you'd prefer just to compile the examples in that directory.

Note that these programs are known to work under MacOS/X and Linux; they should (in principle)
work under Windows as well, but you'll need to find your own way to compile them there since
the Makefiles provided are for gmake and do not (AFAIK) work under Windows.
