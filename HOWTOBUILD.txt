How to build a muscle server ("muscled")

- If you wish to compile muscle.lib and muscled using cmake, do these commands (on any platform):
     cd muscle
     mkdir _build
     cd _build
     cmake ..
     make

  (Under Windows, replace the "make" command above with "devenv /Build Release ALL_BUILD.vcxproj")

Alternatively, on MacOS/X and Linux systems you can build muscle the old-fashioned way:

- Simply cd to the 'server' folder and type 'make'.
  Note that if zlib headers aren't installed on your system, you may 
  need to go into the 'zlib/zlib' folder and do a "./configure;make"
  first.

When the compile finishes, you will have an executable named
'muscled' (or 'muscled.exe' under Windows).  To start the server,
simply run this program.  If you want the server to run in the
background as a daemon process, run it like this:  './muscled daemon'

For more command line options, run './muscled help'
