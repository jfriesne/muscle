How to build a muscle server ("muscled")

- If you wish to compile muscle.lib and muscled using cmake, do these commands (on any platform):
     cd muscle
     cmake -B _build -S .
     cmake --build _build --parallel 8

Alternatively, on MacOS/X and Linux systems you can build muscled the old-fashioned way:
     cd muscle/server
     make -j8

When the compile finishes, you will have an executable named
'muscled' (or 'muscled.exe' under Windows).  To start the server,
simply run this program.  If you want the server to run in the
background as a daemon process, run it like this:  './muscled daemon'

For more command line options, run './muscled help'
