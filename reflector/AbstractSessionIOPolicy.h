 * AbstractReflectSession can associate itself an IO policy for reading,
 * and an IO policy for writing, if it likes.
 * <p>
 * ReflectServer calls the methods in this API in the following sequence:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>BeginIO() called</li>
 *  <li>OkayToTransfer() (called once for each session that wants to transfer data)</li>
 *  <li>GetMaxTransferChunkSize() (called once for each session that was given the okay in the previous step())</li>
 *  <li>server blocks until an event is ready, and then calls DoInput() and/or DoOutput() on sessions that need it()</li>
 *  <li>EndIO() called()</li>
 *  <li>Lather, rinse, repeat</li>
