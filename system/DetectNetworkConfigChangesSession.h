/** This class watches the set of available network interfaces and when that set
  * changes, this class calls the NetworkInterfacesChanged() virtual method on any
  * session or factory object that is attached to the same ReflectServer (including itself).
  *  
  * Note that this functionality is currently implemented for Linux, Windows, and MacOS/X only.
  * Note also that the Windows and MacOS/X implementations currently make use of the MUSCLE
  * Thread class, and therefore won't compile if -DMUSCLE_SINGLE_THREAD_ONLY is set.
  * 
  * This class also provides notification callbacks when the host computer is about to go 
  * to sleep, and when it has just reawoken from sleep.  This can be useful e.g. if you 
  * want to make sure your program's TCP connections get cleanly disconnected and are not 
  * left open while the host computer is sleeping.  This functionality is currently 
  * implemented under MacOS/X and Windows only.
  *
  * @see tests/testnetconfigdetect.cpp for an example usage of this class.
